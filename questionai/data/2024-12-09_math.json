The function is in the form f(x) = ab^x. ## Step 2: Determine the decay factor ### Since the number of trees decreases by 21%, the remaining percentage is 79%. Therefore, the decay factor b is 0.79. ## Step 3: Identify the initial value ### The model estimates that there are 2,800 trees with a diameter of 14 inches. Thus, f(14) = 2,800, which implies a = 2,800 when x = 14. ## Step 4: Formulate the function ### Using the values of a and b, the function can be written as f(x) = 2,800(0.79)^x.",

This means we can use the formula \\( L = k \\cdot W \\), where \\( L \\) is the length, \\( W \\) is the weight, and \\( k \\) is the constant of variation. ## Step 2: Find the Constant of Variation ### Use the given data: 10 lb weight stretches the spring 4 inches.

Solving for \\( k \\), we get \\( k = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\). ## Step 3: Calculate the New Length ### With the constant \\( k = 0.4 \\), calculate the new length for a 33 lb weight: \\( L = 0.4 \\cdot 33 = 13.2 \\) inches.

This does not match the original expression's value. ## Step 4: Explain Yusuf's correctness ### Yusuf correctly broke apart the number 54 into 2 + 52, which maintains the original expression's value. ## Step 5: Explain Tiana's mistake ### Tiana added 2 to 28 to reach the next ten but did not adjust 54 accordingly, resulting in an incorrect total.",

Factor each part: - x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-2)(x-3) - x^2 - 8x + 15 = (x-3)(x-5) - x^2 - 3x - 10 = (x-5)(x+2) - x^2 + 2x - 8 = (x+4)(x-2) 2.

Explanation ## Step 1: Define Variables ### Let x be the duration of each episode of Kenneth's podcast, and y be the duration of each episode of Layla's podcast. ## Step 2: Set Up Equations ### From the given information, we have two scenarios: 1. Last year: 36x + 10y = 3796 2. This year: 36x + 33y = 6234 ## Step 3: Eliminate One Variable ### Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate x: (36x + 33y) - (36x + 10y) = 6234 - 3796 ### Simplifying gives: 23y = 2438 ## Step 4: Solve for y ### Divide both sides by 23: y = \\frac{2438}{23} = 106 ## Step 5: Substitute to Find x ### Substitute y = 106 back into the first equation: 36x + 10(106) = 3796 ### Simplify and solve for x: 36x + 1060 = 3796 36x = 2736 x = \\frac{2736}{36} = 76",

This allows for easy elimination of y by scaling and adding the equations. ## Step 2: Eliminate y ### Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y equal in magnitude: 10x - 4y = 8. Now add this to the second equation: 3x - 4y = -20. This results in 13x = -12. ## Step 3: Solve for x ### Solve the equation 13x = -12 to find x = -\\frac{12}{13}. ## Step 4: Substitute to Find y ### Substitute x = -\\frac{12}{13} back into the first equation: 5(-\\frac{12}{13}) - 2y = 4.

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the roots of the polynomial ### Since the graph of y = f(x) passes through the points (-5,0), (2,0), and (7,0), these points are the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, x = -5, x = 2, and x = 7 are roots. ## Step 2: Determine the factors from the roots ### Each root corresponds to a factor of the polynomial. Therefore, the factors are (x + 5), (x - 2), and (x - 7). ## Step 3: Identify the required factor ### Since the problem asks for a factor of f(x), any of the identified factors could be the answer. However, the problem likely asks for a specific one. Given the typical format of such questions, one of these factors will be listed as an option.",

Using the points (1,4) and (6,0), we calculate m = \\frac{0 - 4}{6 - 1} = \\frac{-4}{5}. ## Step 2: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the line ### The point-slope form of a line is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). Using point (1,4) and slope m = \\frac{-4}{5}, the equation is y - 4 = \\frac{-4}{5}(x - 1). ## Step 3: Simplify the equation to slope-intercept form ### Simplify the equation to y = \\frac{-4}{5}x + \\frac{4}{5} + 4. This simplifies further to y = \\frac{-4}{5}x + \\frac{24}{5}. ## Step 4: Find the y-intercept (b) ### The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0.

Explanation The problem is related to the concept of adverse selection, which is a situation in finance and insurance where individuals with a higher risk of loss are more likely to purchase insurance or engage in financial transactions than those with lower risk. This occurs because the higher-risk individuals have more to gain from the protection offered by insurance or financial products, leading to a disproportionate representation of high-risk individuals. The other options, such as the law of large numbers, probability distribution, and risk pooling, are related to statistical and risk management concepts but do not specifically address the issue of individuals with higher risk seeking more coverage.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the function for total expenditures ### The rate of change of total expenditures is given by f(x) = 8.54x + 87.23. To find the total expenditures function, integrate f(x) with respect to x. This gives F(x) = \\int (8.54x + 87.23) \\, dx = 4.27x^2 + 87.23x + C. Use the initial condition F(0) = 1588.64 to find C. ## Step 2: Solve for the constant C ### Substitute x = 0 and F(0) = 1588.64 into the equation F(x) = 4.27x^2 + 87.23x + C to find C. This gives 1588.64 = 4.27(0)^2 + 87.23(0) + C, so C = 1588.64. ## Step 3: Write the total expenditures function ### Substitute C back into the function: F(x) = 4.27x^2 + 87.23x + 1588.64. ## Step 4: Calculate total expenditures in 2016 ### For 2016, x = 16. Substitute x = 16 into F(x) to find F(16) = 4.27(16)^2 + 87.23(16) + 1588.64.",

However, the equation seems to have a typographical error with \\(x=5\\). Assuming it should be \\(\\frac{1}{x-5}\\), we proceed with solving it. ## Step 2: Find a common denominator ### The common denominator for the left side is \\(2(x-5)\\). Rewrite the equation as \\(\\frac{x-5 + 2}{2(x-5)} = \\frac{11}{p-5}\\). ## Step 3: Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions ### Cross-multiply to get \\((x-5 + 2)(p-5) = 22(x-5)\\). ## Step 4: Simplify and solve for \\(x\\) ### Simplify the equation to get \\(xp - 5x + 2p - 10 = 22x - 110\\).

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Vertex ### The given equation of the parabola is y = (x-1)^2 + 2. This is in the form y = (x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, h = 1 and k = 2, so the vertex is at (1, 2). ## Step 2: Determine Points to the Left of the Vertex ### Choose two x-values to the left of the vertex, such as x = 0 and x = -1. Calculate the corresponding y-values: ### For x = 0: y = (0-1)^2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. So, the point is (0, 3). ### For x = -1: y = (-1-1)^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6. So, the point is (-1, 6). ## Step 3: Determine Points to the Right of the Vertex ### Choose two x-values to the right of the vertex, such as x = 2 and x = 3. Calculate the corresponding y-values: ### For x = 2: y = (2-1)^2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. So, the point is (2, 3). ### For x = 3: y = (3-1)^2 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6. So, the point is (3, 6). ## Step 4: Plot the Points and Draw the Parabola ### Plot the points (-1, 6), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 6) on a graph. Connect these points with a smooth curve to form the parabola.",

Using point (2, 5), the equation becomes y - 5 = \\frac{-5}{6}(x - 2). ## Step 4: Convert to Slope-Intercept Form ### Simplify the equation: y - 5 = \\frac{-5}{6}x + \\frac{10}{6}, which simplifies to y = \\frac{-5}{6}x + \\frac{10}{6} + 5. ## Step 5: Simplify the Equation ### Combine terms to get y = \\frac{-5}{6}x + \\frac{40}{6}. Simplify to y = \\frac{-5}{6}x + \\frac{20}{3}. ## Step 6: Identify the y-intercept ### The y-intercept (b) is the constant term in the equation, which is \\frac{20}{3}.",

            "text": "# Explanation: ## Step1: Base Case ### Verify the statement for \\( n = 1 \\). The left-hand side is \\( 2 \\) and the right-hand side is \\( 1(3 \\cdot 1 - 1) = 2 \\). Both sides are equal, so the base case holds. ## Step2: Inductive Hypothesis ### Assume the statement is true for some natural number \\( k \\), i.e., \\( 2 + 8 + 14 + \\ldots + (6k - 4) = k(3k - 1) \\). ## Step3: Inductive Step ### Show that the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\). The left-hand side for \\( k + 1 \\) is \\( 2 + 8 + 14 + \\ldots + (6k - 4) + (6(k + 1) - 4) \\). Using the inductive hypothesis, this becomes \\( k(3k - 1) + (6(k + 1) - 4) \\). ## Step4: Simplify the Expression ### Simplify \\( k(3k - 1) + 6(k + 1) - 4 \\) to \\( k(3k - 1) + 6k + 6 - 4 = k(3k - 1) + 6k + 2 = 3k^2 - k + 6k + 2 = 3k^2 + 5k + 2 \\). ## Step5: Verify the Right-Hand Side ### The right-hand side for \\( k + 1 \\) is \\( (k + 1)(3(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)(3k + 3 - 1) = (k + 1)(3k + 2) = 3k^2 + 2k + 3k + 2 = 3k^2 + 5k + 2 \\). Both sides match, so the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\). # Answer: ### Yes # Explanation: ## Step1: Inductive Step ### The next step in the proof is to show that if the statement is true for some natural number \\( k \\), then it can be shown to be true for the next natural number \\( k + 1 \\). # Answer: ### C. Show that if the statement is true for some natural number \\( k \\), then it can be shown to be true for the next natural number \\( k + 1 \\).",

This confirms the inductive step. ## Step 5: Conclusion ### Since the base case holds and the inductive step is verified, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n.",

The total revenue from child tickets is \\( 35x \\). The total revenue is \\( 4150 \\). ## Step 3: Solve the Equation ### Set up the equation: \\( 2600 + 35x = 4150 \\). Solve for \\( x \\) by subtracting 2600 from both sides: \\( 35x = 1550 \\). Divide both sides by 35: \\( x = \\frac{1550}{35} = 44.2857 \\).

A score that is 2 or more standard deviations below the mean is considered a failing score. The cutoff for a failing score can be calculated by subtracting 2 times the standard deviation from the mean. The mean score is 58, and the standard deviation is 9. Therefore, the cutoff score is 58 - 2 \\times 9 = 40. To find the percentage of students who failed, we need to determine the proportion of scores that fall below this cutoff in a normal distribution. Using the properties of the normal distribution, approximately 2.5% of scores fall more than 2 standard deviations below the mean.",

Substitute n=1 into the equation: 2 = 1(3 \\times 1 - 1). Both sides equal 2, so the base case holds. ## Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis ### Assume the statement is true for some natural number k: 2 + 8 + 14 + \\ldots + (6k-4) = k(3k-1). ## Step 3: Inductive Step ### Show the statement is true for k+1. Consider the sum 2 + 8 + 14 + \\ldots + (6k-4) + (6(k+1)-4). By the inductive hypothesis, this equals k(3k-1) + (6(k+1)-4). Simplify this expression: \\[ k(3k-1) + 6k + 6 - 4 = 3k^2 - k + 6k + 2 = 3k^2 + 5k + 2 \\] ### Factor and simplify to show it equals (k+1)(3(k+1)-1): \\[ (k+1)(3k+2) = 3k^2 + 2k + 3k + 2 = 3k^2 + 5k + 2 \\] ### Thus, the statement holds for k+1. ## Step 4: Verification for n=0 ### The problem asks to verify for n=0, which is not a natural number. However, if n=0 were considered, the sum would be empty, and the right side would be 0(3 \\times 0 - 1) = 0, which trivially holds.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Rewrite the inequality in slope-intercept form ### Start with the inequality \\frac{1}{2}x - 2y > -6. To express it in the form y = mx + b, solve for y. First, subtract \\frac{1}{2}x from both sides: -2y > -\\frac{1}{2}x - 6. ## Step 2: Solve for y ### Divide every term by -2, remembering to reverse the inequality sign: y < \\frac{1}{4}x + 3. ## Step 3: Graph the boundary line ### Graph the line y = \\frac{1}{4}x + 3. This line is dashed because the inequality is strict (<). ## Step 4: Shade the appropriate region ### Since the inequality is y < \\frac{1}{4}x + 3, shade the region below the line.",

            "text": "### The test statistic x^2 needs to be calculated using the observed and expected frequencies. Once calculated, compare it to the critical value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. If rejected, bettors should consider the post position in horse races. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Hypotheses ### The null hypothesis (H_0) states that wins occur with equal frequency in the different post positions. The alternative hypothesis (H_1) states that at least one post position has a different frequency of wins than the others. ## Step 2: Collect Data and Expected Frequencies ### Gather the observed frequencies of wins for each post position. Calculate the expected frequency for each post position assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is done by dividing the total number of wins by the number of post positions. ## Step 3: Calculate the Chi-Square Test Statistic ### Use the formula for the chi-square test statistic: \\[ x^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\] where \\(O_i\\) is the observed frequency and \\(E_i\\) is the expected frequency for each post position. Sum this value over all post positions. ## Step 4: Determine the Critical Value and Compare ### Determine the critical value for the chi-square distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom (number of post positions minus 1) at the 0.05 significance level. Compare the calculated test statistic to this critical value. ## Step 5: Make a Decision ### If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject the null hypothesis.",

Differentiate both sides with respect to x. ## Step 2: Apply implicit differentiation ### Use the chain rule and product rule to differentiate 2^{xy} and 1 + x^2.

This can be seen as a quadratic in terms of x^2. ## Step 2: Substitute to simplify the polynomial ### Let y = x^2. Then the polynomial becomes 10y^2 - 10y - 60. ## Step 3: Factor the quadratic polynomial ### Factor 10(y^2 - y - 6). The quadratic y^2 - y - 6 factors to (y - 3)(y + 2). ## Step 4: Solve for y ### Set each factor equal to zero: y - 3 = 0 and y + 2 = 0. Thus, y = 3 or y = -2. ## Step 5: Solve for x ### Since y = x^2, solve x^2 = 3 and x^2 = -2. The solutions are x = \\pm\\sqrt{3} and x = \\pm i\\sqrt{2}.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Simplify the expression ### Simplify the expression \\frac{x^9}{x^2} using the law of exponents: \\frac{x^m}{x^n} = x^{m-n}. This gives us x^{9-2} = x^7. ## Step 2: Equate the simplified expression to x^3 ### Since \\frac{x^9}{x^2} = x^3, we equate x^7 = x^3. ## Step 3: Solve for z ### For the equation x^7 = x^3 to hold true for all x \\neq 0, the exponents must be equal: 7 = 3. This implies z = 7 - 3 = 4. However, since the question asks for the value of z in terms of the options given, and the equation x^7 = x^3 is not possible unless x = 0, we need to re-evaluate the context. The question seems to have a typo or misinterpretation. Assuming z was meant to be the exponent difference, z = 7 - 3 = 4 does not match any options.

The confidence interval is calculated as 4.4 \\pm 1.8, which gives the range [2.6, 6.2]. ## Step 2: Evaluate Each Option ### A: Less than 2.6 is not plausible because the lower bound is 2.6. ### B: Between 2.6 and 6.2 is plausible as it matches the confidence interval. ### C: Every employee reading between 4.4 and 9.8 is incorrect because the margin of error applies to the mean, not individual values. ### D: Greater than 6.2 is not plausible because the upper bound is 6.2.",

This is not equivalent to the original equation, so the graph is not symmetric about the y-axis. ## Step 2: Check for x-axis symmetry ### Substitute y with -y in the equation y + x^3 = 60. The equation becomes -y + x^3 = 60, which simplifies to y = x^3 - 60.

By the induction hypothesis, this is equal to \\( k(3k - 1) + (6(k+1) - 4) \\). ### Simplify the expression: \\( k(3k - 1) + 6(k+1) - 4 = 3k^2 - k + 6k + 6 - 4 = 3k^2 + 5k + 2 \\). ### Factor the expression: \\( 3k^2 + 5k + 2 = (k+1)(3k+2) \\). ### Thus, the statement holds for \\( n = k + 1 \\), completing the induction step.",

To factor it, we look for two numbers that multiply to 3 \\times (-8) = -24 and add to 14. These numbers are 16 and -2. Rewrite the trinomial as 3x^2 + 16x - 2x - 8 and factor by grouping: (3x^2 + 16x) + (-2x - 8) = x(3x + 16) - 2(3x + 16) = (x - 2)(3x + 16). Thus, the trinomial is not prime, and (3x - 2) is not a factor. ## Step 2: Solve the Quadratic Equation ### The given equation is 3y^{2} + 1 = -8y. Rearrange it to 3y^{2} + 8y + 1 = 0. Use the quadratic formula y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} with a = 3, b = 8, and c = 1. Calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 64 - 12 = 52. The solutions are y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{52}}{6} = \\frac{-8 \\pm 2\\sqrt{13}}{6} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{3}. Thus, the correct answer is y = \\frac{-4 + \\sqrt{13}}{3}. ## Step 3: Expand the Square of a Binomial ### The expression is (3x + 5y)^2. Use the formula (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Here, a = 3x and b = 5y. Calculate: (3x)^2 = 9x^2, 2(3x)(5y) = 30xy, and (5y)^2 = 25y^2. Thus, the expansion is 9x^2 + 30xy + 25y^2.",

The expanded form is g(x) = 280 + 40x - 28x - 4x^2 = -4x^2 + 12x + 280. ## Step 2: Identify the type of quadratic function ### Recognize that g(x) = -4x^2 + 12x + 280 is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, indicating it opens downwards and has a maximum point. ## Step 3: Find the vertex of the quadratic ### Use the vertex formula x = -\\frac{b}{2a} for the quadratic ax^2 + bx + c to find the x-coordinate of the vertex. For g(x) = -4x^2 + 12x + 280, a = -4 and b = 12. Therefore, x = -\\frac{12}{2(-4)} = \\frac{12}{8} = 1.5.",

            "text": "### The lines intersect at the point \\left(\\frac{24}{13}, \\frac{23}{13}\\right). Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the equations ### The system of equations is given as y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 3 and y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 1. ## Step 2: Determine the slopes and y-intercepts ### The first equation has a slope of -\\frac{2}{3} and a y-intercept of 3. The second equation has a slope of \\frac{3}{2} and a y-intercept of -1. ## Step 3: Graph the equations ### Plot the y-intercepts on the y-axis and use the slopes to find another point for each line. Draw the lines through these points. ## Step 4: Find the intersection point ### Solve the system by setting the equations equal to each other: -\\frac{2}{3}x + 3 = \\frac{3}{2}x - 1. Solve for x to find the intersection point. ## Step 5: Solve for x ### Multiply through by 6 to eliminate fractions: -4x + 18 = 9x - 6. Combine like terms: 18 + 6 = 9x + 4x. Simplify to get 24 = 13x. Solve for x: x = \\frac{24}{13}. ## Step 6: Solve for y ### Substitute x = \\frac{24}{13} into one of the original equations, say y = -\\frac{2}{3}x + 3, to find y. Calculate y = -\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{24}{13} + 3 = -\\frac{48}{39} + 3 = \\frac{39}{13} - \\frac{48}{39}. Simplify to find y = \\frac{15}{13}. ## Step 7: Verify the solution ### Verify by substituting x = \\frac{24}{13} into the second equation y = \\frac{3}{2}x - 1 to ensure the same y value is obtained. Calculate y = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{24}{13} - 1 = \\frac{36}{13} - 1 = \\frac{36}{13} - \\frac{13}{13} = \\frac{23}{13}. The intersection point is consistent.",

For g(x) = 10(x), substitute x = 0 to find g(0). Thus, g(0) = 10(0) = 0. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept is b = 0. ## Step 2: Analyze the given options ### We need to find a function h(x) that is equivalent to g(x) and displays b = 0 as a constant or coefficient. Check each option to see which one satisfies this condition. ## Step 3: Evaluate each option ### Option A: h(x) = 4(16)^{6x-5} does not have b = 0 as a constant or coefficient. ### Option B: h(x) = 16(\\frac{1}{4})^{6x-5} does not have b = 0 as a constant or coefficient. ### Option C: h(x) = 16,384(4)^{6x} does not have b = 0 as a constant or coefficient. ### Option D: h(x) = 16,384(\\frac{1}{4})^{6x} does not have b = 0 as a constant or coefficient. ## Step 4: Determine the correct option ### Since none of the options directly show b = 0 as a constant or coefficient, the problem might be misinterpreted or the options might not be correctly aligned with the function g(x) = 10(x).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Correct Statement ### In statistics, a confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter. The correct interpretation is about the confidence in the interval containing the population mean, not the sample mean or probability. ## Step 2: Calculate the Confidence Interval ### The formula for a confidence interval is \\text{mean} \\pm (\\text{z-score} \\times \\text{standard error}). For a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96. ## Step 3: Compute the Interval ### Calculate the interval: 5.89\\% \\pm (1.96 \\times 0.44\\%). This results in the interval 5.89\\% \\pm 0.8624\\%, which gives the range [5.03\\%, 6.75\\%]. ## Step 4: Evaluate Incorrect Statements ### Statement A is incorrect because it implies a probability about the population mean, which is not how confidence intervals are interpreted. Statement C is incorrect because it refers to the sample mean, which is known and not subject to confidence intervals.",

To convert 0.0681\\overline{81} to a fraction, let x = 0.0681\\overline{81}. Then 1000x = 68.181818... and 100000x = 6818.181818.... Subtracting these gives 99000x = 6750, so x = \\frac{6750}{99000} = \\frac{75}{1100} = \\frac{15}{220} = \\frac{3}{44}.

This is because the expression inside the square root is (x-4). ## Step 3: Determine the Domain ### The domain of h(x) = \\sqrt{x-4} is x \\geq 4, as the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. ## Step 4: Graph the Transformed Function ### Start with the graph of y = \\sqrt{x} and shift it 4 units to the right. This results in the graph of h(x) = \\sqrt{x-4}.",

Set y = 0 to find the x-intercept: 2x - 3(0) = 12 \\Rightarrow x = 6. ## Step 3: Draw the boundary line ### Plot the intercepts (0, -4) and (6, 0) on a graph and draw a dashed line through these points, since the inequality is strict (<). ## Step 4: Determine the shading region ### Choose a test point not on the line, such as (0, 0). Substitute into the inequality: 2(0) - 3(0) < 12 \\Rightarrow 0 < 12 (true). Shade the region containing (0, 0).",

Thus, \\sqrt[5]{y^{10}} = y^{10/5} = y^2. ## Step 4: Combine the simplified parts ### Combine the simplified numerator and denominator: \\frac{2\\sqrt[5]{x}}{y^2}.",

We need to check if these equations can intersect with the existing two lines at a single point. ## Step 3: Convert Equations to Slope-Intercept Form ### Convert the equations to the form y = mx + b to find their slopes. - For equation I: 16x + 4y = -7 \\Rightarrow 4y = -16x - 7 \\Rightarrow y = -4x - \\frac{7}{4} - For equation II: -4x + 16y = -1 \\Rightarrow 16y = 4x - 1 \\Rightarrow y = \\frac{1}{4}x - \\frac{1}{16} ## Step 4: Determine Intersection Conditions ### For all three lines to intersect at exactly one point, the third line must not be parallel to either of the first two lines.

Explanation ## Step 1: Find a common denominator ### The common denominator for the fractions is (x+7)(x+8). Multiply both sides by this common denominator to eliminate the fractions. ## Step 2: Simplify the inequality ### After multiplying, the inequality becomes 3(x+8) > 4(x+7). Simplify this to 3x + 24 > 4x + 28. ## Step 3: Solve for x ### Rearrange the inequality to isolate x: 3x + 24 > 4x + 28 becomes 24 - 28 > 4x - 3x, which simplifies to -4 > x. ## Step 4: Determine critical values ### The critical values are the points where the original rational expressions are undefined or equal. Set x+7=0 and x+8=0 to find undefined points: x = -7 and x = -8. There are no zeros since the inequality is strict. ## Step 5: Create a sign chart ### Evaluate the sign of the expression \\frac{3}{x+7} - \\frac{4}{x+8} in the intervals determined by the critical values: (-\\infty, -8), (-8, -7), and (-7, \\infty). ## Step 6: Determine solution intervals ### The inequality \\frac{3}{x+7} > \\frac{4}{x+8} holds where the expression is positive.

Expand the right side: (3x)^2 = 9x^2. ## Step 3: Set the Equation to Zero ### Combine terms to form a quadratic equation: x^2 + 88x + 1936 = 9x^2. Rearrange to: 8x^2 - 88x - 1936 = 0. ## Step 4: Simplify the Quadratic Equation ### Divide the entire equation by 8: x^2 - 11x - 242 = 0. ## Step 5: Solve the Quadratic Equation ### Use the quadratic formula: x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = -11, c = -242. Calculate: x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{121 + 968}}{2}. ## Step 6: Calculate the Roots ### Simplify under the square root: x = \\frac{11 \\pm \\sqrt{1089}}{2}.

For ordering purposes, we consider x^2 as a non-negative number. ## Step2: Evaluate \\sqrt{57} ### Calculate the approximate value of \\sqrt{57}. It is approximately 7.55. ## Step3: Compare the values ### Compare the numerical values: x^2, 18, and \\sqrt{57} \\approx 7.55. Since x^2 is variable, it could be any non-negative number. For ordering, assume x^2 is less than 7.55, between 7.55 and 18, or greater than 18. ## Step4: Order from least to greatest ### The order depends on the value of x^2.

These imply potential solutions to a quadratic or linear equation. ## Step 3: Solve for Potential Equations ### Without a specific equation, assume a quadratic form like x^2 - 11x = 0 which factors to x(x - 11) = 0. Solutions would be x = 0 and x = 11. ## Step 4: Match Solutions to Options ### Compare the solutions to the provided options. None match exactly, but option C (0 and -11) is closest if considering a sign error.",

We need to find its roots. ## Step 2: Use the Rational Root Theorem ### The Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root, in the form of \\frac{p}{q}, must have p as a factor of the constant term (-5) and q as a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Possible rational roots are \\pm 1, \\pm 5. ## Step 3: Test possible rational roots ### Substitute each possible rational root into g(x) to see if it equals zero. - g(1) = 1^3 - 6 \\cdot 1^2 + 10 \\cdot 1 - 5 = 0. Thus, x = 1 is a root. ## Step 4: Perform polynomial division ### Divide g(x) by (x - 1) to find the quotient polynomial, which will be quadratic. - Use synthetic division: - Coefficients: 1, -6, 10, -5 - Root: 1 - Result: x^2 - 5x + 5 ## Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation ### Solve x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0 using the quadratic formula: x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. - Here, a = 1, b = -5, c = 5. - Discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = 25 - 20 = 5. - Roots: x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}.",

For 35 seconds, Z = \\frac{35 - 28}{5} = 1.4. ## Step 2: Find the probability of a commercial lasting longer than 35 seconds ### Using the Z-score of 1.4, consult the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a commercial lasts less than 35 seconds, which is approximately 0.9192. Therefore, the probability of lasting longer is 1 - 0.9192 = 0.0808 or 8.08%. ## Step 3: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the total time of 30 advertisements ### The mean total time for 30 advertisements is 30 \\times 28 = 840 seconds. The standard deviation for the total time is \\sqrt{30} \\times 5 = 27.39 seconds. ## Step 4: Calculate the Z-score for exceeding 15 minutes (900 seconds) ### The Z-score is Z = \\frac{900 - 840}{27.39} \\approx 2.19. ## Step 5: Find the probability of the total time exceeding 900 seconds ### Using the Z-score of 2.19, consult the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that the total time is less than 900 seconds, which is approximately 0.9857. Therefore, the probability of exceeding 900 seconds is 1 - 0.9857 = 0.0143 or 1.43%.",

Therefore, the total number of sections for 9th graders is \\( 25 \\times 2 = 50 \\). ## Step4: Calculate the total number of sections for 10th graders ### Each 10th grader has a test with 3 sections.

From the table, the total number of people above 35 years old is 162. The number of people above 35 years old with a hemoglobin level between 9 and 11 is not provided directly, but the number with a level above 11 is 40. ## Step 2: Calculate the missing data ### The total number of people with hemoglobin levels between 9 and 11 across all ages is 101 (from the table: 49 + 52). Since the total number of people with hemoglobin levels less than 9 is 129, and those above 11 is 109 (69 + 40), the number of people with hemoglobin levels between 9 and 11 is 101. ## Step 3: Calculate the probability ### To find the probability, we need the number of people above 35 with hemoglobin levels of 9 or above. This is the sum of those with levels between 9 and 11 and those above 11. Since the total number of people above 35 is 162, and those with levels less than 9 are 76, the number with levels 9 or above is 162 - 76 = 86. The probability is then \\frac{86}{162}.",

Evaluate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given statement: LHS: \\( 6 \\) RHS: \\( 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 + 1) = 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\) Both sides are equal, so the base case is true. ## Step2: Inductive Step ### Assume the statement is true for some natural number \\( k \\). Assume \\( 6 + 12 + 18 + \\cdots + 6k = 3k(k + 1) \\) is true. ### Show the statement is true for \\( k + 1 \\). Consider the sum for \\( k + 1 \\): \\[ 6 + 12 + 18 + \\cdots + 6k + 6(k + 1) \\] Using the inductive hypothesis: \\[ 3k(k + 1) + 6(k + 1) \\] Factor out \\( 3(k + 1) \\): \\[ 3(k + 1)(k + 2) \\] This matches the right-hand side of the statement for \\( n = k + 1 \\): \\[ 3(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) \\] ## Step3: Conclusion ### By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \\( n \\).",

Since f(x) has an x-intercept at x=14, f(14)=0. ## Step 3: Determine the effect of the denominator on the x-intercepts of g(x) ### The denominator x-14 introduces a vertical asymptote at x=14, which means g(x) is undefined at x=14. ## Step 4: Count the remaining x-intercepts ### The remaining x-intercepts of f(x) (excluding x=14) will be the x-intercepts of g(x). Therefore, g(x) will have 6 x-intercepts.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Simulation Results ### The problem provides four different probabilities for a 50\\% shooter to have a streak of 10 or more made shots in 30 attempts. These probabilities are based on the results of a simulation. ## Step 2: Analyze the Probabilities ### The probabilities given are 2\\%, 20\\%, 50\\%, and 60\\%. The task is to identify which probability is the most reasonable estimate based on the simulation. ## Step 3: Evaluate the Likelihood of Each Probability ### A 50\\% shooter has a relatively low chance of making 10 consecutive shots, as the probability of making each shot is only 0.5. Therefore, a lower probability estimate is more reasonable.",

Here, a = 1, b = -(k - 5), and c = 64. ## Step 3: Calculate the Discriminant ### Calculate the discriminant: (-(k - 5))^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 64 < 0, which simplifies to (k - 5)^2 < 256. ## Step 4: Solve the Inequality ### Solve the inequality (k - 5)^2 < 256. This gives -16 < k - 5 < 16. ## Step 5: Find the Range of k ### Solve for k: -16 + 5 < k < 16 + 5, which simplifies to -11 < k < 21. ## Step 6: Determine the Greatest Integer Value ### The greatest integer value of k within this range is 20.",

The possible rational roots are \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm \\frac{1}{5}, \\pm \\frac{2}{5}. ## Step 2: Test Possible Roots ### Substitute each possible rational root into g(x) to determine if it equals zero. Start with 1: g(1) = -5(1)^3 + 15(1)^2 - 9(1) - 2 = -5 + 15 - 9 - 2 = -1. Since g(1) \\neq 0, 1 is not a root.

Explanation ## Step 1: Define the Null and Alternative Hypotheses ### The null hypothesis (H_0) is that the proportion of students using the browser at the university is equal to the worldwide market share, p = 0.201. The alternative hypothesis (H_a) is that the proportion is greater than the worldwide market share, p > 0.201. ## Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic ### Use the formula for the test statistic for a proportion: z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}, where \\hat{p} = \\frac{30}{120} = 0.25, p_0 = 0.201, and n = 120. Calculate z. ### z = \\frac{0.25 - 0.201}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.201 \\times (1-0.201)}{120}}} = \\frac{0.049}{0.036} \\approx 1.361 ## Step 3: Find the P-value ### The p-value is the probability that the test statistic is at least as extreme as the observed value under the null hypothesis. Use the standard normal distribution to find this probability for z = 1.361. ### The p-value is approximately 0.087. ## Step 4: State the Conclusion ### Compare the p-value to the significance level (commonly 0.05). Since 0.087 > 0.05, do not reject the null hypothesis.",

            "text": "### The value of \\(b \\) is \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\). Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the slope of the line ### The slope \\(m \\) of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). Here, the points are \\((1, 8)\\) and \\((6, 0)\\). Thus, the slope is \\(m = \\frac{0 - 8}{6 - 1} = \\frac{-8}{5} \\). ## Step 2: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the line ### The point-slope form of a line is \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\). Using the point \\((1, 8)\\) and the slope \\(-\\frac{8}{5}\\), the equation becomes \\(y - 8 = -\\frac{8}{5}(x - 1) \\). ## Step 3: Simplify the equation to find the y-intercept ### Simplifying the equation \\( y - 8 = -\\frac{8}{5}x + \\frac{8}{5} \\), we get \\( y = -\\frac{8}{5}x + \\frac{8}{5} + 8 \\). Converting 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 5, we have \\( y = -\\frac{8}{5}x + \\frac{8}{5} + \\frac{40}{5} \\), which simplifies to \\( y = -\\frac{8}{5}x + \\frac{48}{5} \\). ## Step 4: Identify the y-intercept ### The y-intercept \\( b \\) is the constant term in the equation, which is \\(\\frac{48}{5}\\).",

Calculate 16^{\\frac{3}{2}} which is (16^{\\frac{1}{2}})^3 = 4^3 = 64. ## Step 4: Solve for x ### Add 4 to both sides to solve for x: x - 4 = 64 \\implies x = 64 + 4 = 68. ## Step 5: Check the solution ### Substitute x = 68 back into the original equation to verify: (68-4)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 64^{\\frac{2}{3}} = (4^3)^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 4^2 = 16.

Both sides are equal, so the base case holds. ## Step 2: Assume the statement is true for n=k ### Assume 6 + 12 + 18 + \\cdots + 6k = 3k(k+1) is true for some natural number k. ## Step 3: Prove the statement for n=k+1 ### Consider the statement for n=k+1: 6 + 12 + 18 + \\cdots + 6k + 6(k+1). By the induction hypothesis, this equals 3k(k+1) + 6(k+1). ## Step 4: Simplify the expression ### Simplify the expression: 3k(k+1) + 6(k+1) = (3k + 6)(k+1) = 3(k+1)(k+2). ## Step 5: Conclude the induction step ### The expression 3(k+1)(k+2) matches the right side of the statement for n=k+1.

The equation becomes y = 2x + 8, so the slope m = 2. ## Step 2: Determine the slope of the perpendicular line ### The slope of a line perpendicular to another is the negative reciprocal of the original slope. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is -\\frac{1}{2}. ## Step 3: Use the point-slope form to find the equation ### Use the point-slope form y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) with point (5, 4) and slope -\\frac{1}{2}.

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Function Type ### The function y = 3 \\cdot 4^x is an exponential function because it involves a constant base raised to a variable exponent. ## Step 2: Determine Key Characteristics ### The base of the exponential function is 4, which is greater than 1, indicating that the function is increasing. The coefficient 3 is a vertical stretch factor. ## Step 3: Find Key Points ### Calculate a few key points to help plot the graph. For example, when x = 0, y = 3 \\cdot 4^0 = 3. When x = 1, y = 3 \\cdot 4^1 = 12. When x = -1, y = 3 \\cdot 4^{-1} = \\frac{3}{4}. ## Step 4: Sketch the Graph ### Plot the key points on a coordinate plane and sketch the curve. The graph will pass through the points (0, 3), (1, 12), and (-1, 0.75), and will increase rapidly as x increases. ## Step 5: Analyze Asymptotic Behavior ### The graph approaches the x-axis as an asymptote but never touches it, as y approaches 0 when x approaches negative infinity.",

            "text": "### Test Statistic: 1.21 ### p-value: 0.226 ### Conclusion: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the market share at the university is different from the worldwide market share. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Hypotheses ### The null hypothesis (H_0) is that the proportion of students using the browser is equal to the worldwide market share, p = 0.201. The alternative hypothesis (H_a) is that the proportion is different from the worldwide market share, p \\neq 0.201. ## Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic ### Use the formula for the test statistic for a proportion: z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}, where \\hat{p} = \\frac{30}{120} = 0.25, p_0 = 0.201, and n = 120. ### Calculate: z = \\frac{0.25 - 0.201}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.201(1-0.201)}{120}}} \\approx 1.21. ## Step 3: Calculate the p-value ### The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the null hypothesis. For a two-tailed test, this is 2 \\times P(Z > |1.21|). ### Using standard normal distribution tables or software, find P(Z > 1.21) \\approx 0.1131. Thus, the p-value is 2 \\times 0.1131 = 0.2262. ## Step 4: State the Conclusion ### Compare the p-value to the significance level (commonly \\alpha = 0.05). Since 0.2262 > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. ### Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the market share at the university is different from the worldwide market share.",

The equation now becomes 2^{3x+9} = 2^{x-8}. ## Step 4: Set the exponents equal ### Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal: 3x + 9 = x - 8. ## Step 5: Solve for x ### Solve the equation 3x + 9 = x - 8 to find the value of x.",

Explanation In this problem, we are examining the relationship between the number of hours Reagan spends reading each day (h) and the number of days it will take her to finish the book (d). The independent variable is the one that can be controlled or changed, while the dependent variable is the one that responds to the change in the independent variable. Here, Reagan decides how many hours to read each day, making 'h' the independent variable. The number of days 'd' it takes to finish the book depends on 'h', thus making 'd' the dependent variable.",

Since P(x) = 2\\sqrt[3]{x} + 3 is a composition of a cube root function and a linear function, it is one-to-one. ## Step 2: Solve for x in terms of y ### Set y = P(x) = 2\\sqrt[3]{x} + 3 and solve for x. Subtract 3 from both sides to get y - 3 = 2\\sqrt[3]{x}. Then divide by 2 to get \\frac{y - 3}{2} = \\sqrt[3]{x}. Finally, cube both sides to solve for x: x = \\left(\\frac{y - 3}{2}\\right)^3. ## Step 3: Write the inverse function ### The inverse function is P^{-1}(y) = \\left(\\frac{y - 3}{2}\\right)^3.",

Calculate z = \\frac{22.6 - 24}{\\frac{8.1}{\\sqrt{60}}}. ## Step 3: Compute the P-value ### Find the P-value corresponding to the calculated z-value using standard normal distribution tables or software. ## Step 4: Compare P-value with Significance Level ### Compare the P-value with \\alpha = 0.05 to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. ## Step 5: State the Conclusion ### Based on the comparison, determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the claim.",

A rational function is undefined when its denominator is zero. Therefore, set x-8 = 0 to find the restriction. ## Step 2: Solve for the restriction ### Solving x-8 = 0 gives x = 8. This means x = 8 is not in the domain of the function. ## Step 3: Define the domain ### The domain of the function is all real numbers except where the function is undefined. Thus, the domain is \\{ x \\mid x \\text{ is a real number and } x \\neq 8 \\}.",

From these premises, we can deduce: - Since all frobos are snibbles and all snibbles are glarks, all frobos are glarks. - Since no glarks are gribbles, it follows that no frobos (which are glarks) can be gribbles. Thus, the statement that must be true is that no snibbles are gribbles, as all snibbles are glarks, and no glarks are gribbles.",

Here, the center is (3, 10) and the radius is 3 (since r^{2} = 9). ## Step 2: Use the distance formula to find c ### The point (6, c) lies on the circle, so the distance from (6, c) to the center (3, 10) must be equal to the radius. Using the distance formula: \\sqrt{(6-3)^{2}+(c-10)^{2}} = 3. ## Step 3: Solve the equation for c ### Simplify the equation: \\sqrt{3^{2}+(c-10)^{2}} = 3. This becomes 3^{2} + (c-10)^{2} = 3^{2}. Simplifying further, (c-10)^{2} = 0. Therefore, c-10 = 0. ## Step 4: Find the value of c ### Solving c-10 = 0 gives c = 10.",

Explanation The confidence interval mentioned is based on a sample size of \\( n = 30 \\). A confidence interval provides a range within which we expect the true population parameter to lie, given our sample data. The interval from 0.12 to 0.13 is specific to the data from this particular sample. If we were to take another sample of the same size, the data would likely differ due to natural sampling variability. This variability arises because each sample may capture different elements of the population, leading to different sample means and, consequently, different confidence intervals. The likelihood of obtaining the exact same confidence interval from a different sample is very low, as the sample mean and standard deviation would likely vary, affecting the interval's endpoints.",

            "text": "b. There is a negative correlation. The more missing assignments you have, the lower your average is likely to be. Explanation In the context of education, the relationship between the number of missing assignments and a student's average grade is typically analyzed through correlation. A negative correlation would imply that as the number of missing assignments increases, the average grade tends to decrease, which is the most common expectation in educational settings. This is because missing assignments often result in lower overall grades due to incomplete coursework. A positive correlation would suggest the opposite, which is generally unlikely, and no correlation would mean that missing assignments do not affect the average grade.",

The volume is V_{Sun} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (7 \\times 10^{8})^3. ## Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the volumes ### The ratio of the volumes is \\frac{V_{Sun}}{V_{golf}} = \\frac{(7 \\times 10^{8})^3}{(2 \\times 10^{-2})^3}. ## Step 5: Simplify the ratio ### Simplifying gives \\frac{7^3 \\times (10^{8})^3}{2^3 \\times (10^{-2})^3} = \\frac{343 \\times 10^{24}}{8 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{343}{8} \\times 10^{30}. ## Step 6: Approximate the final result ### \\frac{343}{8} \\approx 42.875, so the ratio is approximately 42.875 \\times 10^{30} \\approx 4.2875 \\times 10^{31}. ## Step 7: Express in scientific notation ### The result is approximately 4.2875 \\times 10^{31}, which is closest to 10^{32} in scientific notation.",

Then divide by 3 to isolate \\(\\sin x\\), resulting in \\(\\sin x = -\\frac{2}{3}\\). ## Step 2: Find the general solutions for \\(x\\) ### Use the inverse sine function to find \\(x\\).

The principal value is \\(x \\approx -0.7297\\). ## Step 3: Determine solutions in the interval \\([0, 2\\pi)\\) ### Since the sine function is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\), find additional solutions by considering the symmetry of the sine function.

            "text": "1. The unit rate in miles per gallon is 18\\frac{3}{4}. 2. The fraction representing the unit rate in gallons per mile is \\frac{4}{75}. Explanation ## Step 1: Convert Mixed Number to Improper Fraction Convert 3\\frac{3}{4} to an improper fraction. This is done by multiplying the whole number by the denominator and adding the numerator: 3 \\times 4 + 3 = 15. So, 3\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{15}{4}. ## Step 2: Calculate Unit Rate in Miles per Gallon To find the unit rate in miles per gallon, divide the distance by the gallons: \\frac{\\frac{15}{4}}{\\frac{1}{5}}. This is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal: \\frac{15}{4} \\times \\frac{5}{1} = \\frac{75}{4} = 18\\frac{3}{4}. ## Step 3: Calculate Unit Rate in Gallons per Mile To find the unit rate in gallons per mile, take the reciprocal of the miles per gallon: \\frac{\\frac{1}{5}}{\\frac{15}{4}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{4}{15} = \\frac{4}{75}.",

            "text": "The opposite side lengths of both triangles are parallel. Explanation In geometry, alternate interior angles are formed when a transversal crosses two parallel lines. According to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, these angles are congruent. In the context of the problem, the statement \"The opposite side lengths of both triangles are parallel\" implies that the lines are parallel, which justifies the congruency of the alternate interior angles. Additionally, the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Congruency Theorem states that if two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent. This theorem supports the congruency of corresponding parts, including alternate interior angles, when the triangles are congruent.",

Explanation The problem involves determining whether there is a significant difference in opinions between mothers and daughters regarding purchasing a product. This is a psychological study focusing on opinion and perception differences within family dynamics. The researcher uses a paired sample t-test to analyze the mean difference in ratings, with a significance level of \\alpha = 0.05. The mean difference is 0.85, and the standard deviation is 1.59. The hypothesis test will compare the p-value to the significance level to determine if the observed difference is statistically significant. The statement \"Because the P-value is less than \\alpha, there is evidence that, on average, mothers and daughters like those in the study would have different opinions about purchasing the product\" is correct if the p-value is indeed less than 0.05. This would indicate that the difference in opinions is statistically significant. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than 0.05, the statement \"Because the P-value is greater than \\alpha, there is evidence that, on average, mothers and daughters like those in the study would have different opinions about purchasing the product\" is incorrect because it suggests a misunderstanding of hypothesis testing. The correct interpretation would be that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude a difference in opinions.",
