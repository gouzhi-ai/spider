Substitute these into the formula: 6 = 25 + (3 - 25) e^{-k \\cdot 1}. ## Step 4: Solve for k ### Rearrange to find k: 6 - 25 = (3 - 25) e^{-k}, which simplifies to -19 = -22 e^{-k}. Thus, e^{-k} = \\frac{19}{22}, and k = -\\ln(\\frac{19}{22}). ## Step 5: Determine the temperature at time t ### Substitute k back into the formula: T(t) = 25 + (3 - 25) e^{-kt}, where k = -\\ln(\\frac{19}{22}). ## Step 6: Calculate time when temperature is 80\\% of ambient ### 80\\% of 25^{\\circ}C is 20^{\\circ}C. Set T(t) = 20 and solve for t: 20 = 25 + (3 - 25) e^{-kt}, which simplifies to -5 = -22 e^{-kt}. Thus, e^{-kt} = \\frac{5}{22} and solve for t: t = \\frac{-\\ln(\\frac{5}{22})}{k}.",

We need to evaluate this limit as x approaches 0. ## Step 2: Apply L'Hôpital's Rule ### Since the limit is in the indeterminate form \\frac{0}{0}, we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule, which involves differentiating the numerator and the denominator. ## Step 3: Differentiate the Numerator and Denominator ### Differentiate the numerator: \\frac{d}{dx}(1 - e^{6x}) = -6e^{6x}. ### Differentiate the denominator: \\frac{d}{dx}(7x) = 7. ## Step 4: Evaluate the New Limit ### Substitute the derivatives into the limit: \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-6e^{6x}}{7}. ### As x \\rightarrow 0, e^{6x} \\rightarrow 1. Thus, the limit becomes \\frac{-6 \\cdot 1}{7} = -\\frac{6}{7}. ## Step 5: Round the Result ### The result -\\frac{6}{7} is approximately -0.857 when rounded to three decimal places.",

The equation becomes 18y + 18 - 16 = 15y - 3 - 15. ## Step 2: Combine like terms ### Simplify both sides: 18y + 2 = 15y - 18. ## Step 3: Move terms involving y to one side ### Subtract 15y from both sides: 18y - 15y + 2 = -18 becomes 3y + 2 = -18. ## Step 4: Solve for y ### Subtract 2 from both sides: 3y = -20.

The domain is all real numbers except zero. ## Step 2: Find the x-intercepts ### The x-intercepts occur where h(x) = 0. For h(x) = -\\frac{13}{x^2}, the function is never zero because the numerator is a non-zero constant. Thus, there are no x-intercepts. ## Step 3: Find the y-intercept ### The y-intercept occurs where x = 0.

The correct multiple-choice answer is D. shrunk vertically by a factor of \\frac{1}{5}, reflected over the x-axis. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify Horizontal Transformation ### The expression inside the absolute value, x+5, indicates a horizontal shift. Since it is x+5, the graph shifts 5 units to the left. ## Step 2: Identify Vertical Stretch/Shrink ### The coefficient -\\frac{1}{5} in front of the absolute value indicates a vertical shrink by a factor of \\frac{1}{5}. ## Step 3: Identify Reflection ### The negative sign in front of the coefficient -\\frac{1}{5} indicates a reflection over the x-axis. ## Step 4: Identify Vertical Translation ### The constant term -2 at the end of the equation indicates a vertical shift downward by 2 units.",

An example of an inverted delta is less commonly defined but could refer to complex deltas with unusual shapes. Explanation Deltas are landforms created by the deposition of sediment carried by rivers as they enter a larger body of water, like an ocean or a lake. They can take various shapes depending on factors like sediment supply, wave action, and tidal processes. 1. An arcuate delta is characterized by a rounded, fan-like shape, often formed where wave action is strong enough to smooth out the edges of the delta. A classic example is the Nile Delta in Egypt. 2. A cuspate delta has a pointed, tooth-like shape, typically formed where strong wave action from two directions shapes the delta. The Tiber Delta in Italy is an example. 3. A bird-foot delta has protruding distributaries that resemble a bird's foot, often formed in areas with low wave energy and high sediment supply. The Mississippi River Delta in the USA is a well-known example. 4. An inverted delta is less common and can refer to deltas that have a more complex or unusual shape, often influenced by local geological conditions.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the problems ### The problem consists of multiple sub-problems related to number theory, including proofs using mathematical induction and calculations of GCF and LCM. ## Step 2: Solve each sub-problem ### Each sub-problem will be addressed individually using appropriate mathematical techniques. ### Sub-problem 12a: Prove by induction that 1^{3}+2^{3}+\\ldots +n^{3}=(\\frac {n(n+1)}{2})^{2} #### Base Case: For n=1, LHS = 1^3 = 1 and RHS = (\\frac{1(1+1)}{2})^2 = 1. Base case holds. #### Inductive Step: Assume true for n=k, i.e., 1^3 + 2^3 + \\ldots + k^3 = (\\frac{k(k+1)}{2})^2. Prove for n=k+1. #### LHS for n=k+1: 1^3 + 2^3 + \\ldots + k^3 + (k+1)^3 = (\\frac{k(k+1)}{2})^2 + (k+1)^3. #### RHS: (\\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2})^2. #### Show LHS = RHS by algebraic manipulation. Inductive step holds. ### Sub-problem 12b: Prove by induction that 1+4+7+\\ldots +(3n-2)=\\frac {n(3n-1)}{2} #### Base Case: For n=1, LHS = 1 and RHS = \\frac{1(3 \\times 1 - 1)}{2} = 1. Base case holds. #### Inductive Step: Assume true for n=k, i.e., 1 + 4 + \\ldots + (3k-2) = \\frac{k(3k-1)}{2}. Prove for n=k+1. #### LHS for n=k+1: 1 + 4 + \\ldots + (3k-2) + (3(k+1)-2). #### RHS: \\frac{(k+1)(3(k+1)-1)}{2}. #### Show LHS = RHS by algebraic manipulation. Inductive step holds. ### Sub-problem 12c: Prove by induction that 6^{n}-1 is divisible by 5 #### Base Case: For n=1, 6^1 - 1 = 5, divisible by 5. Base case holds. #### Inductive Step: Assume true for n=k, i.e., 6^k - 1 is divisible by 5. Prove for n=k+1. #### 6^{k+1} - 1 = 6 \\cdot 6^k - 1 = 6(6^k - 1) + 5. #### Since 6^k - 1 is divisible by 5, 6^{k+1} - 1 is divisible by 5. Inductive step holds. ### Sub-problem 12d: Prove by induction that n! > 3^n, n \\geq 7 #### Base Case: For n=7, 7! = 5040 and 3^7 = 2187. 7! > 3^7. Base case holds. #### Inductive Step: Assume true for n=k, i.e., k! > 3^k. Prove for n=k+1. #### (k+1)! = (k+1) \\cdot k! > (k+1) \\cdot 3^k. #### Since k+1 \\geq 8, (k+1) \\cdot 3^k > 3^{k+1}. Inductive step holds. ### Sub-problem 13: Find the GCF and LCM of 168, 198, and 360. #### GCF: Find common prime factors. GCF = 6. #### LCM: Use the formula \\text{LCM}(a, b, c) = \\frac{a \\times b \\times c}{\\text{GCF}(a, b, c)}. LCM = 55440. ### Sub-problem 14: Given GCF = 13 and LCM = 273, find the number between 60 and 140. #### Use the relation \\text{GCF} \\times \\text{LCM} = a \\times b. Possible numbers: 91. ### Sub-problem 15: Sum = 45, Product = 500. Find GCF. #### Solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 45x + 500 = 0. Roots: 20 and 25. GCF = 5. ### Sub-problem 16: Given GCF = 18, LCM = 1134, and b=162, find product and a. #### Product: a \\times b = \\text{GCF} \\times \\text{LCM} = 20412. #### a = \\frac{20412}{162} = 126. ### Sub-problem 17: LCM of p and q is 935, p > q. Maximize sum of digits of q. #### Possible q: 85. Sum of digits = 13. ### Sub-problem 18: Relation between p, q, r and GCF/LCM. #### General relation: \\text{GCF}(p, q, r) \\times \\text{LCM}(p, q, r) = p \\times q \\times r. ### Sub-problem 19: If n=4p, p prime, find even divisors. #### n = 4p, divisors: 1, 2, 4, p, 2p, 4p. Total: 6. ### Sub-problem 20: Which of 2p, 3p, p-2, p-3 may be prime? #### p-2 may be prime if p=3. ### Sub-problem 21: Prove difference of squares of consecutive odd integers is divisible by 8. #### Let integers be 2k+1 and 2k+3. Difference: (2k+3)^2 - (2k+1)^2 = 8k + 8. Divisible by 8.",

These include: 1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear. 2. **Normality of errors**: The residuals (errors) should be normally distributed. 3. **Constant Standard Deviation of errors (Homoscedasticity)**: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variable. The condition \"Residuals must be fan-shaped\" is not a standard assumption of linear regression. In fact, a fan-shaped pattern in residuals typically indicates heteroscedasticity, which violates the assumption of constant standard deviation of errors.",

There is not enough evidence to support the claim that toast lands buttered side down more than 50% of the time. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the null and alternative hypotheses ### The null hypothesis (H_0) is that the proportion of toast landing buttered side down is 0.50. The alternative hypothesis (H_1) is that the proportion is not 0.50. ## Step 2: Calculate the test statistic ### The test statistic is given as z = -0.88. ## Step 3: Determine the P-value ### Use the standard normal distribution to find the P-value corresponding to z = -0.88. The P-value is the probability that the test statistic is more extreme than observed, under the null hypothesis. ## Step 4: Compare the P-value to the significance level ### Compare the P-value to \\alpha = 0.05. If the P-value is less than \\alpha, reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject it. ## Step 5: Conclusion based on the P-value ### If the P-value is greater than 0.05, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the toast lands buttered side down 50% of the time. If the intent was to test if it lands more than 50% of the time, the conclusion remains the same due to the P-value.",

Substituting b = 2 and a = 1, we get h = -\\frac{2}{2 \\times 1} = -1. ## Step 3: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex ### Substitute x = -1 into the function f(x) to find the y-coordinate: k = f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 8 = 1 - 2 - 8 = -9. ## Step 4: Determine if the vertex is a maximum or minimum ### Since the coefficient of x^2 (which is a = 1) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, indicating a minimum point at the vertex. ## Step 5: Determine the range of the function ### Since the parabola opens upwards and the minimum value is at k = -9, the range is y \\geq -9 in interval notation: [-9, \\text{inf}).",

Solve this quadratic equation. ## Step 3: Find the roots of the characteristic equation ### The roots are r = -1, -1 (a repeated root). ## Step 4: Write the general solution ### For repeated roots, the general solution is y(x) = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 x e^{-x}. ## Step 5: Apply the initial condition ### Use y(1) = 3 to find C_1 and C_2. Substitute x = 1 into the general solution: 3 = C_1 e^{-1} + C_2 (1) e^{-1}. ### Simplify to get 3 = (C_1 + C_2) e^{-1}, which implies C_1 + C_2 = 3e. ## Step 6: Solve for constants ### Since there is only one initial condition, assume C_2 = 0 for simplicity. Thus, C_1 = 3e. ## Step 7: Write the particular solution ### Substitute C_1 and C_2 back into the general solution to get y(x) = 3e e^{-x}.",

The formula is \\( N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt} \\), where \\( N(t) \\) is the amount remaining at time \\( t \\), \\( N_0 \\) is the initial amount, and \\( k \\) is the decay constant. ## Step 2: Determine the decay constant ### Given \\( N_0 = 8 \\) g and \\( N(3) = 4 \\) g, use the formula \\( 4 = 8 e^{-3k} \\) to find \\( k \\). Solving gives \\( e^{-3k} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), thus \\( -3k = \\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) \\), and \\( k = -\\frac{\\ln(\\frac{1}{2})}{3} \\). ## Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after 4 years ### Use the decay model with \\( t = 4 \\) and the calculated \\( k \\) to find \\( N(4) = 8 e^{-4k} \\). Substitute \\( k \\) from Step 2 to find \\( N(4) \\). ## Step 4: Solve for \\( N(4) \\) ### Substitute \\( k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\) into \\( N(4) = 8 e^{-4 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3}} \\).

            "text": "### The statement is false. A whisper is approximately 4.77 decibels louder than the rustle of leaves, not three times as loud. Explanation ## Step1: Understand the Decibel Scale Formula ### The decibel scale formula given is \\beta _{2}-\\beta _{1}=10 \\log(\\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}), where \\beta represents the sound level in decibels and I represents the intensity of the sound. ## Step2: Analyze the Statement ### The statement claims that a whisper is three times as loud as the rustle of leaves. This implies I_{2} = 3I_{1}. ## Step3: Apply the Formula ### Substitute I_{2} = 3I_{1} into the formula: \\beta _{2}-\\beta _{1}=10 \\log(\\frac{3I_{1}}{I_{1}}) = 10 \\log(3). ## Step4: Calculate the Decibel Difference ### Compute 10 \\log(3). Using logarithm properties, \\log(3) \\approx 0.477. Therefore, 10 \\log(3) \\approx 10 \\times 0.477 = 4.77 decibels. ## Step5: Conclusion ### A difference of 4.77 decibels means that a whisper is not three times as loud as the rustle of leaves in terms of perceived loudness, as the decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify Vertical Asymptotes and Holes ### The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator is not zero. Factor the denominator: x^2 - 36 = (x-6)(x+6). The function has a hole at x=6 because both the numerator and denominator are zero at this point, canceling each other out. The vertical asymptote is at x=-6. ## Step 2: Determine Horizontal Asymptotes ### For horizontal asymptotes, compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asymptote is y=0. ## Step 3: Plot Points and Analyze Behavior ### Choose values of x around the vertical asymptote and hole to determine the behavior of the function. Evaluate f(x) at these points to understand the graph's behavior.",

These numbers are 3 and 4. So, we rewrite the middle term and factor by grouping: 4x^2 + 4x + 3x + 3 = (4x^2 + 4x) + (3x + 3) = 4x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = (4x + 3)(x + 1). ## Step 2: Factor the denominator ### The denominator 4x^2 - x - 3 can be factored similarly by finding two numbers that multiply to 4 \\times (-3) = -12 and add to -1. These numbers are -3 and 4. So, we rewrite the middle term and factor by grouping: 4x^2 + 4x - 3x - 3 = (4x^2 - 3x) + (4x - 3) = x(4x - 3) + 1(4x - 3) = (x + 1)(4x - 3). ## Step 3: Simplify the expression ### The expression \\frac{(4x + 3)(x + 1)}{(x + 1)(4x - 3)} can be simplified by canceling the common factor (x + 1) from the numerator and the denominator.",

            "text": "### Y-intercept: A. The y-intercept is \\frac{1}{6}; X-intercept: A. The x-intercept(s) is/are 6. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the y-intercept ### To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 in the function f(x) = \\frac{x-6}{x^2-36}. This results in f(0) = \\frac{0-6}{0^2-36} = \\frac{-6}{-36} = \\frac{1}{6}. Therefore, the y-intercept is \\frac{1}{6}. ## Step 2: Identify the x-intercepts ### To find the x-intercepts, set the numerator equal to zero: x - 6 = 0. Solving gives x = 6. Thus, the x-intercept is 6. ## Step 3: Analyze symmetry ### The function f(x) = \\frac{x-6}{x^2-36} is not symmetric about the y-axis or the origin. This can be verified by checking f(-x) and comparing it to f(x) and -f(x). ## Step 4: Determine vertical asymptotes ### The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, x^2 - 36 = 0. Solving gives x = \\pm 6. ## Step 5: Determine horizontal asymptotes ### Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. ## Step 6: Plot key points and asymptotes ### Plot the intercepts, asymptotes, and a few additional points to sketch the graph. ## Step 7: Sketch the graph ### Use the information from the previous steps to sketch the graph of the function.",

            "text": "### Y-axis symmetry: Yes ### Origin symmetry: No ### Y-intercept: A. The y-intercept is 0 ### X-intercept: A. The x-intercept(s) is/are 0 Explanation ## Step1: Determine Symmetry ### Check for symmetry by substituting -x into f(x). If f(-x) = f(x), it has y-axis symmetry; if f(-x) = -f(x), it has origin symmetry. Here, f(-x) = \\frac{2(-x)^2}{(-x)^2 - 4} = \\frac{2x^2}{x^2 - 4} = f(x), indicating y-axis symmetry. Therefore, the function has y-axis symmetry. ## Step2: Find the y-intercept ### The y-intercept is found by evaluating f(0). f(0) = \\frac{2(0)^2}{0^2 - 4} = 0. Thus, the y-intercept is 0. ## Step3: Find the x-intercepts ### Set the numerator equal to zero: 2x^2 = 0. Solving gives x = 0. Therefore, the x-intercept is 0. ## Step4: Identify Vertical Asymptotes ### Set the denominator equal to zero: x^2 - 4 = 0. Solving gives x = \\pm 2. These are the vertical asymptotes. ## Step5: Identify Horizontal Asymptotes ### Since the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, the horizontal asymptote is y = \\frac{2}{1} = 2. ## Step6: Analyze End Behavior ### As x \\to \\pm \\infty, f(x) \\to 2. The end behavior is consistent with the horizontal asymptote. ## Step7: Sketch the Graph ### Combine all information: y-axis symmetry, y-intercept at 0, x-intercept at 0, vertical asymptotes at x = \\pm 2, and horizontal asymptote at y = 2.",

Thus, \\log(x+3) - \\log(x+1) = \\log(\\frac{x+3}{x+1}). ## Step2: Exponentiate both sides for Question 12 ### Set the equation \\log(\\frac{x+3}{x+1}) = 2. Exponentiate both sides to get \\frac{x+3}{x+1} = 10^2 = 100. ## Step3: Solve for x for Question 12 ### Solve the equation \\frac{x+3}{x+1} = 100 by cross-multiplying: x+3 = 100(x+1). Simplify to get x+3 = 100x + 100. Rearrange to 97x = -97. Therefore, x = -1. ## Step4: Simplify the logarithmic equation for Question 13 ### Use the properties of logarithms: \\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab). Thus, \\ln(x) + \\ln(x-4) = \\ln(x(x-4)) = \\ln(x^2 - 4x). ## Step5: Equate the logarithmic expressions for Question 13 ### Set the equation \\ln(x^2 - 4x) = \\ln(6x). Since the arguments of the logarithms are equal, x^2 - 4x = 6x. ## Step6: Solve for x for Question 13 ### Rearrange the equation to x^2 - 10x = 0. Factorize to get x(x-10) = 0. Therefore, x = 0 or x = 10. Since x = 0 is not valid in the context of logarithms, x = 10.",

These do not change the shape or size of the triangle but move it to a new position. ## Step 3: Apply a translation ### Translate \\Delta JKL by a vector (a, b) to move it to a new position. The new coordinates will be J'(x_1+a, y_1+b), K'(x_2+a, y_2+b), and L'(x_3+a, y_3+b). ## Step 4: Apply a rotation ### Rotate \\Delta JKL around a point (e.g., the origin or one of its vertices) by an angle \\theta. Use rotation matrices to find the new coordinates. ## Step 5: Apply a reflection ### Reflect \\Delta JKL over a line (e.g., the x-axis, y-axis, or any line y=mx+c). Use reflection formulas to determine the new coordinates. ## Step 6: Determine the final coordinates of \\Delta RST ### Combine the effects of the translation, rotation, and reflection to find the final coordinates of \\Delta RST.",

            "text": "### It will take approximately 4.1 years for the sample of the substance to decay to 84% of its original amount. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the given values ### The half-life is 24 years, and we want the time for the substance to decay to 84% of its original amount. ## Step 2: Use the half-life to find the decay constant \\( k \\) ### The formula for half-life is \\( A = A_0 e^{kt} \\). At half-life, \\( A = \\frac{A_0}{2} \\) and \\( t = 24 \\). So, \\( \\frac{1}{2} = e^{24k} \\). ## Step 3: Solve for \\( k \\) ### Take the natural logarithm of both sides: \\( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 24k \\). Thus, \\( k = \\frac{\\ln(0.5)}{24} \\). ## Step 4: Use the decay model to find the time \\( t \\) ### Substitute \\( A = 0.84A_0 \\) and the value of \\( k \\) into the decay model: \\( 0.84 = e^{kt} \\). ## Step 5: Solve for \\( t \\) ### Take the natural logarithm of both sides: \\( \\ln(0.84) = kt \\). Solve for \\( t \\) using \\( t = \\frac{\\ln(0.84)}{k} \\).",

            "text": "### (a) The fireworks will reach their maximum height in 2.5 seconds. ### (b) The maximum height is 107 feet. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the vertex of the quadratic function ### The maximum height of a projectile modeled by a quadratic function occurs at the vertex. For a quadratic function in the form \\( h(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\), the time at which the maximum height occurs is given by \\( t = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\). ## Step 2: Calculate the time at which the maximum height occurs ### Given \\( h(t) = -16t^2 + 80t + 7 \\), we have \\( a = -16 \\) and \\( b = 80 \\). Thus, the time \\( t \\) is calculated as: \\[ t = -\\frac{80}{2 \\cdot -16} = \\frac{80}{32} = 2.5 \\text{ seconds} \\] ## Step 3: Verify the given time for maximum height ### The given time for maximum height is 2.5 seconds, which matches our calculation. ## Step 4: Calculate the maximum height ### Substitute \\( t = 2.5 \\) into the function \\( h(t) \\): \\[ h(2.5) = -16(2.5)^2 + 80(2.5) + 7 \\] \\[ h(2.5) = -16(6.25) + 200 + 7 \\] \\[ h(2.5) = -100 + 200 + 7 = 107 \\text{ feet} \\]",

This is the standard form of a hyperbola centered at (h, k) with vertical transverse axis. ## Step 2: Find the center ### The center of the hyperbola is (h, k). From the equation, h = -1 and k = 4. Therefore, the center is (-1, 4). ## Step 3: Determine the transverse axis ### Since the y term is positive and comes first, the transverse axis is parallel to the y-axis. ## Step 4: Find the vertices ### The vertices are located a units from the center along the transverse axis. Here, a^2 = 25, so a = 5. The vertices are at (-1, 4 \\pm 5), which are (-1, 9) and (-1, -1). ## Step 5: Find the foci ### The foci are located c units from the center along the transverse axis, where c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Here, b^2 = 1, so b = 1. Therefore, c^2 = 25 + 1 = 26, so c = \\sqrt{26}. The foci are at (-1, 4 \\pm \\sqrt{26}). ## Step 6: Determine the asymptotes ### The asymptotes for a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis are given by y - k = \\pm \\frac{a}{b}(x - h). Substituting a = 5, b = 1, h = -1, k = 4, we get y - 4 = \\pm 5(x + 1).",

This indicates that the ellipse is horizontal with the semi-major axis along the x-axis. ## Step 3: Determine the values of a and b ### Since the x-intercepts are \\pm 3, we have a = 3. The value of b is not directly given, but it can be any positive number. ## Step 4: Formulate the equation ### Using a = 3 and the general form for a horizontal ellipse, the equation is \\frac{x^2}{3^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, which simplifies to \\frac{x^2}{9} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.",

            "text": "The graphs of FC, VC, and TC illustrate the cost structure in economics. FC is a horizontal line, VC is an upward-sloping curve starting from the origin, and TC is an upward-sloping curve starting from the level of FC on the y-axis. The TC curve is parallel to the VC curve and always above it by the amount of the fixed cost. Explanation The problem involves understanding and describing the graphs of Total Cost (TC), Variable Cost (VC), and Fixed Cost (FC) in economics. 1. **Nature of the Graphs**: - **Fixed Cost (FC)**: This is a horizontal line on the graph since fixed costs do not change with the level of output. They remain constant regardless of the quantity produced. - **Variable Cost (VC)**: This graph typically starts from the origin (0,0) and increases as the level of output increases. The shape of the VC curve can vary but generally, it is upward sloping, reflecting that variable costs increase with higher production. - **Total Cost (TC)**: The TC graph starts from the point where the FC graph intersects the y-axis (representing the fixed costs when output is zero). The TC curve is the sum of FC and VC at each level of output, hence it is also upward sloping and parallel to the VC curve but starts higher due to the addition of FC. 2. **Relationship between TC and VC**: - **Mathematical Relationship**: The Total Cost (TC) is the sum of Fixed Cost (FC) and Variable Cost (VC). This can be expressed as: \\[ TC = FC + VC \\] - **Graphical Relationship**: Since FC is constant, the TC curve is essentially the VC curve shifted upwards by the amount of the FC. Therefore, the distance between the TC and VC curves at any level of output is equal to the fixed cost.",

The alternative hypothesis (H_a) is that the proportion of fruit flies alive after 25 days eating organic bananas (p_0) is greater than the proportion of fruit flies alive eating conventional bananas (p_c). ## Step2: Calculate the test statistic ### The test statistic for comparing two proportions is given by: z = \\frac{p_0 - p_c}{SE}  where SE is the standard error of the difference in proportions. Given p_0 = 0.43, p_c = 0.40, and SE = 0.03, we have: z = \\frac{0.43 - 0.40}{0.03} = 1.00  ## Step3: Find the p-value ### The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the null hypothesis. For a one-tailed test with z = 1.00, we look up the p-value in the standard normal distribution table. p-value = P(Z \\geq 1.00)  Using the standard normal distribution table, the p-value corresponding to z = 1.00 is approximately 0.158.",

Explanation The binomial expansions of \\((a+b)^n\\) are directly related to Pascal's Triangle. Each row of Pascal's Triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the expanded form of \\((a+b)^n\\). For example, in the expansion of \\((a+b)^2\\), the coefficients are 1, 2, 1, which match Row 2 of Pascal's Triangle (121). Similarly, for \\((a+b)^3\\), the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1, matching Row 3 (1331). Each element in a row of Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row, which aligns with the binomial coefficient calculation.",

Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \\( x \\). \\[ x + 5 = 0 \\implies x = -5 \\] Thus, the vertical asymptote is at \\( x = -5 \\). ## Step2: Identify the horizontal asymptote ### For horizontal asymptotes, compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (2) is greater than the degree of the denominator (1), there is no horizontal asymptote. ## Step3: Identify the oblique asymptote ### Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, there is an oblique asymptote. Perform polynomial long division to find the oblique asymptote. \\[ \\frac{x^2 - 8}{x + 5} = x - 5 + \\frac{17}{x + 5} \\] Thus, the oblique asymptote is \\( y = x - 5 \\).",

Explanation ## Step1: Define the relation R ### The relation \\( R \\) on the set of all integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is defined as \\( mRn \\Leftrightarrow m \\equiv n \\pmod{3} \\). ## Step2: Prove Reflexivity ### For any integer \\( m \\), \\( m \\equiv m \\pmod{3} \\) because the difference \\( m - m = 0 \\) is divisible by 3. Therefore, \\( mRm \\) holds for all \\( m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).

This implies \\( n - m \\) is also divisible by 3, hence \\( n \\equiv m \\pmod{3} \\). Therefore, \\( nRm \\) holds. This proves symmetry. ## Step4: Prove Transitivity ### If \\( mRn \\) and \\( nRp \\), then \\( m \\equiv n \\pmod{3} \\) and \\( n \\equiv p \\pmod{3} \\). This means \\( m - n \\) and \\( n - p \\) are both divisible by 3. Adding these, \\( (m - n) + (n - p) = m - p \\) is also divisible by 3.

            "text": "### a) Yes, X is a binomial random variable. ### b) P(X = 5) \\approx 0.201 ### c) Mean = 3.7, Standard Deviation \\approx 1.54 ### d) P(X \\geq 8) \\approx 0.014, which is less than 0.05, so it is unusual. Explanation ## Step 1: Determine if X is a binomial random variable ### A binomial distribution requires a fixed number of trials, two possible outcomes, constant probability of success, and independent trials. Here, we have 10 trials (adults), two outcomes (visit or not visit), constant probability (37%), and independent selection. Thus, X is a binomial random variable. ## Step 2: Calculate the probability of exactly 5 adults visiting ### Use the binomial probability formula: P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, where n=10, k=5, and p=0.37. Calculate P(X = 5). ## Step 3: Calculate the mean and standard deviation ### The mean \\mu of a binomial distribution is n \\cdot p and the standard deviation \\sigma is \\sqrt{n \\cdot p \\cdot (1-p)}. Calculate these for n=10 and p=0.37. ## Step 4: Determine if having 8 or more adults is unusual ### Calculate P(X \\geq 8) using the binomial probability formula for X = 8, 9, 10 and sum these probabilities. Compare the result to a threshold (commonly 0.05) to determine if it's unusual.",

So, \\( \\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{48}{49} \\).

Explanation ## Step 1: Describe the Sampling Distribution ### The sampling distribution of the sample mean for a sample size of 36 will be normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem. The mean of the sampling distribution will be the same as the population mean, which is 75.3. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution, also known as the standard error, is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size: \\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{8.4}{\\sqrt{36}} = 1.4. ## Step 2: Calculate the Probability ### To find the probability that the sample mean is at least 80, we need to calculate the z-score for 80 using the sampling distribution: z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}} = \\frac{80 - 75.3}{1.4} = 3.36. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find the probability corresponding to a z-score of 3.36. The probability that the sample mean is less than 80 is approximately 0.9996. Therefore, the probability that the sample mean is at least 80 is 1 - 0.9996 = 0.0004.",

Note that in this case, n=10 (the numerals 0 through 9) and r=6 (the number of numerals that the plate can display). Explanation ## Step1: Define arrangements with repetition ### Arrangements with repetition refer to the number of ways to arrange 'r' items from 'n' choices where repetition of items is allowed. ## Step2: Formula for arrangements with repetition ### The formula for arrangements with repetition is given by n^r, where 'n' is the number of choices and 'r' is the number of selections. ## Step3: Example of using the n^r formula ### Identify the correct example where the n^r formula applies. In this case, the example should involve selecting items where repetition is allowed. ## Step4: Evaluate the options ### Option A involves scheduling classes without repetition, so it does not apply. ### Option B involves creating license plates with numerals where repetition is allowed, which fits the n^r formula. ### Option C involves selecting a relay team without repetition, so it does not apply. ### Option D involves selecting ice cream flavors without repetition, so it does not apply.",

The complete graph of the function is a quartic curve with these zeros, and it will have end behavior similar to y = 2x^4, rising to infinity as x \\to \\pm \\infty. Explanation ## Step 1: Find the Zeros of the Polynomial ### To find the zeros of the polynomial f(x) = 2x^{4} - 6x^{3} - 4x^{2} + 4x + 24, we need to solve the equation f(x) = 0. We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test potential rational roots and then use synthetic division to factor the polynomial. ## Step 2: Apply the Rational Root Theorem ### The Rational Root Theorem suggests that potential rational roots are factors of the constant term (24) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (2). This gives us potential roots: \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 8, \\pm 12, \\pm 24. ## Step 3: Test Potential Roots ### By testing these potential roots using synthetic division, we find that x = 2 is a root. Performing synthetic division with x - 2, we get a quotient polynomial. ## Step 4: Factor the Quotient Polynomial ### After dividing, the quotient polynomial is 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x - 12. We continue factoring this polynomial by testing more roots or using techniques like factoring by grouping. ## Step 5: Solve the Remaining Polynomial ### Further factorization or solving of the cubic polynomial gives us the remaining roots. For instance, x = -1 and x = 3 are also roots. ## Step 6: Draw the Complete Graph ### With the zeros found, we can sketch the graph. The polynomial is degree 4, so it will have end behavior similar to y = 2x^4. The zeros are x = 2, x = -1, x = 3, and the graph will cross the x-axis at these points. Consider the multiplicity of roots and the sign of the leading coefficient to determine the shape of the graph between and beyond these points.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Round the numbers using front-end rounding ### Round the number of users in Country D (77 million) and Country F (30.09 million) to the nearest ten million. Country D rounds to 80 million and Country F rounds to 30 million. ## Step 2: Estimate the difference using rounded numbers ### Subtract the rounded number of users in Country F from the rounded number of users in Country D: \\(80 \\, \\text{million} - 30 \\, \\text{million} = 50 \\, \\text{million}\\). ## Step 3: Calculate the exact difference ### Subtract the exact number of users in Country F from the exact number of users in Country D: \\(77 \\, \\text{million} - 30.09 \\, \\text{million} = 46.91 \\, \\text{million}\\).",

The region of integration is determined by the limits of integration. The outer integral limits \\(x\\) from 0 to 7, and for each \\(x\\), \\(y\\) ranges from 0 to \\(\\sqrt{49-x^2}\\). This describes a quarter-circle in the first quadrant with radius 7. ## Step 2: Sketch the Region ### The region is a quarter-circle in the first quadrant with radius 7, centered at the origin. ## Step 3: Convert to Polar Coordinates ### Use polar coordinates where \\(x = r \\cos \\theta\\) and \\(y = r \\sin \\theta\\). The Jacobian of the transformation is \\(r\\). The limits for \\(r\\) are from 0 to 7, and for \\(\\theta\\) from 0 to \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). ## Step 4: Evaluate the Integral ### The integral becomes \\(\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\int_{0}^{7} r^2 \\, dr \\, d\\theta\\). First, integrate with respect to \\(r\\): \\(\\int_{0}^{7} r^2 \\, dr = \\left[\\frac{r^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{7} = \\frac{343}{3}\\). ## Step 5: Integrate with Respect to \\(\\theta\\) ### Now integrate with respect to \\(\\theta\\): \\(\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{343}{3} \\, d\\theta = \\frac{343}{3} \\left[\\theta\\right]_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} = \\frac{343}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{343\\pi}{6}\\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand Confidence Intervals ### A confidence interval provides a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter. The confidence level indicates the probability that the interval contains the parameter. ## Step 2: Compare 99% and 95% Confidence Intervals ### A 99% confidence interval is wider than a 95% confidence interval, providing greater certainty that the interval contains the population parameter. This is because a higher confidence level requires a wider range to ensure the parameter is captured. ## Step 3: Evaluate the Options ### Option a is correct because a 99% confidence interval suggests greater certainty in containing the population parameter compared to a 95% confidence interval. Options b, c, and d are incorrect because a higher confidence level does not imply a smaller range, more accurate sample mean, or lower standard deviation.",

The calculated test statistic is approximately 3.37. The P-value is less than 0.10, so we reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the mean number of words per page is greater than 46.9 words, implying that there are more than 70,000 defined words in the dictionary. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Null and Alternative Hypotheses ### The null hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\)) is that the mean number of words per page is equal to 46.9 words. The alternative hypothesis (\\( H_1 \\)) is that the mean number of words per page is greater than 46.9 words. Thus, the correct choice is C. \\( \\mathrm{H}_{0}: \\mu=46.9 \\) words, \\( \\mathrm{H}_{1}: \\mu>46.9 \\) words. ## Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic ### Use the formula for the t-test statistic: \\( t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} \\), where \\( \\bar{x} = 59.3 \\), \\( \\mu_0 = 46.9 \\), \\( s = 16.4 \\), and \\( n = 20 \\). Calculate \\( t = \\frac{59.3 - 46.9}{\\frac{16.4}{\\sqrt{20}}} \\). ## Step 3: Determine the P-value ### Using the calculated t-value and degrees of freedom (\\( n-1 = 19 \\)), find the P-value from the t-distribution table for a one-tailed test. ## Step 4: State the Conclusion ### Compare the P-value with the significance level (\\( \\alpha = 0.10 \\)). If the P-value is less than \\( \\alpha \\), reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, do not reject it.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Problem ### We need to estimate the length of the road using the left-endpoint values of the recorded velocities at 10-second intervals. ## Step 2: Apply the Left-Endpoint Rule ### The left-endpoint rule involves using the velocity at the beginning of each interval to estimate the distance traveled. The formula for each interval is: \\(\\text{Distance} = \\text{Velocity} \\times \\text{Time Interval}\\). ## Step 3: Calculate the Distance for Each Interval ### We calculate the distance for each 10-second interval using the left-endpoint velocities: - Interval 0-10s: \\(0 \\times 10 = 0\\) - Interval 10-20s: \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\) - Interval 20-30s: \\(30 \\times 10 = 300\\) - Interval 30-40s: \\(22 \\times 10 = 220\\) - Interval 40-50s: \\(23 \\times 10 = 230\\) - Interval 50-60s: \\(26 \\times 10 = 260\\) - Interval 60-70s: \\(23 \\times 10 = 230\\) - Interval 70-80s: \\(48 \\times 10 = 480\\) - Interval 80-90s: \\(32 \\times 10 = 320\\) - Interval 90-100s: \\(37 \\times 10 = 370\\) - Interval 100-110s: \\(41 \\times 10 = 410\\) - Interval 110-120s: \\(14 \\times 10 = 140\\) ## Step 4: Sum the Distances ### Add up all the distances calculated for each interval to estimate the total length of the road.",

The null hypothesis \\(H_0 \\) states that the proportion of the ethnicity in the jury selection is equal to the proportion in the eligible population, \\( p = 0.787 \\). The alternative hypothesis \\( H_1 \\) suggests that the proportion is different, \\( p \\neq 0.787 \\), indicating potential bias. Given the problem statement, the correct hypothesis test is option A. The test statistic \\( z \\) is calculated using the formula for the test of proportions: \\[ z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}} \\] where \\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{0.40 \\times 889}{889} = 0.40\\), \\(p_0 = 0.787\\), and \\(n = 889\\). Substituting the values, we calculate: \\[ z = \\frac{0.40 - 0.787}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.787 \\times (1-0.787)}{889}}} \\] The P-value is then determined from the standard normal distribution. If the P-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting bias. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no evidence of bias.",

Explanation ## Step1: Identify the distribution of X ### The age of students is uniformly distributed between -5 and 10 years old. This means \\(X \\sim U(-5, 10)\\). ## Step2: Identify the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{x}\\) ### For a uniform distribution \\(U(a, b)\\), the mean \\(\\mu\\) is \\(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is \\(\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\). The sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) for a sample size \\(n\\) is approximately normal \\(N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})\\) due to the Central Limit Theorem. ## Step3: Calculate the mean and variance of X ### Mean: \\(\\mu = \\frac{-5 + 10}{2} = 2.5\\) ### Variance: \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{(10 - (-5))^2}{12} = \\frac{15^2}{12} = 18.75\\) ## Step4: Determine the distribution of \\(\\overline{x}\\) ### Since \\(n = 40\\), the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{x}\\) is \\(N(2.5, \\frac{18.75}{40}) = N(2.5, 0.46875)\\) ## Step5: Calculate the probability that the sample mean is between 7 and 7.3 ### Convert the sample mean to the standard normal distribution: \\(Z = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\) ### For \\(\\overline{x} = 7\\), \\(Z = \\frac{7 - 2.5}{\\sqrt{0.46875}} = 6.6033\\) ### For \\(\\overline{x} = 7.3\\), \\(Z = \\frac{7.3 - 2.5}{\\sqrt{0.46875}} = 6.9967\\) ### The probability \\(P(7 \\leq \\overline{x} \\leq 7.3)\\) is the area under the standard normal curve between these Z-values, which is extremely small and practically 0.",

Therefore, the vertex is (-1, 7). ## Step2: Determine the axis of symmetry ### The axis of symmetry for a parabola in the form y = a(x-h)^2 + k is x = h. Thus, the axis of symmetry is x = -1. ## Step3: Find the y-intercept ### To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y. y = \\frac{2}{3}(0+1)^2 + 7 = \\frac{2}{3} + 7 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{21}{3} = \\frac{23}{3}.

Exponentiate both sides to remove the natural log: (x+11)e^3 = e^5. ## Step 3: Isolate x ### Divide both sides by e^3: x+11 = e^{5-3} = e^2. Then, subtract 11 from both sides: x = e^2 - 11.",

No, the assumption that the distribution is normal is not necessary due to the Central Limit Theorem. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the distribution and parameters The problem states that the average number of Facebook friends is normally distributed with a mean (\\mu) of 115 and a standard deviation (\\sigma) of 59. For a sample of size n = 46, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also normal with mean \\mu = 115 and standard deviation \\sigma/\\sqrt{n} = 59/\\sqrt{46}. ## Step 2: Calculate the probability for part a To find the probability that the sample mean is less than 103, we need to calculate the z-score: z = \\frac{103 - 115}{59/\\sqrt{46}}. Then, use the standard normal distribution to find the probability corresponding to this z-score. ## Step 3: Calculate the first quartile for part b The first quartile (Q1) corresponds to the 25th percentile of the normal distribution. Use the z-score for the 25th percentile, which is approximately -0.675, and solve for the sample mean: Q1 = \\mu + z \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}. ## Step 4: Evaluate the necessity of normality assumption for part c For part a, the normality assumption is not strictly necessary due to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean approaches normality as the sample size increases, typically n \\geq 30 is sufficient.",

            "text": "### In order to have a margin of error of 1\\%, 9604 children should be polled. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the formula for margin of error ### The margin of error (ME) for a proportion is given by the formula: ME = z \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}, where z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the proportion, and n is the sample size. ## Step 2: Determine the z-score for a 95\\% confidence level ### For a 95\\% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.96. ## Step 3: Set up the equation for the margin of error ### We want the margin of error to be 0.01 (or 1\\%). So, 0.01 = 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 \\cdot 0.5}{n}}. ## Step 4: Solve for the sample size n ### Rearrange the equation to solve for n: n = \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5}{(0.01)^2}. ## Step 5: Calculate the value of n ### Compute n = \\frac{(1.96)^2 \\cdot 0.25}{0.0001} = \\frac{3.8416 \\cdot 0.25}{0.0001} = \\frac{0.9604}{0.0001} = 9604. ## Step 6: Round up to the nearest whole number ### Since we need to round up, the final sample size is 9604.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Complete the Sample Space ### The sample space for rolling a 4-sided die twice includes all possible ordered pairs of outcomes. Each die has 4 faces, so there are 4 \\times 4 = 16 possible outcomes. The missing outcomes are: (2,2), (3,4), and (4,3). The complete sample space is S=\\{(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4)\\}. ## Step 2: Determine the Support of X ### The support of X, the sum of the recorded values, ranges from the smallest sum (2, from (1,1)) to the largest sum (8, from (4,4)). Therefore, the support is S_{X}=\\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}. ## Step 3: Calculate P(X=3) ### The probability P(X=3) is given as \\frac{8}{16}. This is incorrect; P(X=3) should be calculated based on the sample space. There are 2 outcomes that sum to 3: (1,2) and (2,1). Therefore, P(X=3)=\\frac{2}{16}=\\frac{1}{8}. ## Step 4: Calculate P(X \\leq 6) ### To find P(X \\leq 6), count the outcomes where X is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. There are 13 such outcomes: (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3). Thus, P(X \\leq 6)=\\frac{13}{16}. ## Step 5: Find x for PMF f(x)=\\frac{1}{4} ### The probability mass function f(x)=\\frac{1}{4} suggests that x corresponds to a sum with 4 outcomes. The sum 5 has 4 outcomes: (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1). Therefore, x=5. ## Step 6: Find x for CDF F(x)=\\frac{13}{16} ### The cumulative distribution function F(x)=\\frac{13}{16} indicates the probability of X \\leq x. For x=6, P(X \\leq 6)=\\frac{13}{16}. Therefore, x=6.",

Completing the square can help identify the precise shift. ## Step 5: Determine vertical shift ### The change from +2 to -8 indicates a vertical shift downward.",

The second ship travels at 28 miles per hour for 2 hours, so it covers 28 \\times 2 = 56 miles. ## Step 2: Apply the Law of Cosines ### The angle between the paths of the two ships is 130^\\circ. Using the Law of Cosines, the distance d between the two ships is given by the formula: \\[ d^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C) \\] where \\( a = 60 \\) miles, \\( b = 56 \\) miles, and \\( C = 130^\\circ \\). ## Step 3: Calculate the cosine of the angle ### Calculate \\cos(130^\\circ). Using a calculator, \\cos(130^\\circ) \\approx -0.6428. ## Step 4: Substitute values into the Law of Cosines ### Substitute the values into the formula: \\[ d^2 = 60^2 + 56^2 - 2 \\times 60 \\times 56 \\times (-0.6428) \\] \\[ d^2 = 3600 + 3136 + 4305.984 \\] \\[ d^2 = 11041.984 \\] ## Step 5: Solve for the distance ### Take the square root of both sides to find \\( d \\): \\[ d = \\sqrt{11041.984} \\approx 105.1 \\]",

Here, h = 2 and k = 1, so the vertex is (2, 1). ## Step 3: Determine the Direction of the Parabola ### Since the coefficient of (x-2)^2 is positive (\\frac{1}{2}), the parabola opens upwards. ## Step 4: Identify the Axis of Symmetry ### The axis of symmetry for the parabola is the vertical line x = 2, which passes through the vertex. ## Step 5: Plot Additional Points ### Choose values of x around the vertex to find additional points. For example, for x = 1, f(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-2)^2 + 1 = 1.5. Similarly, for x = 3, f(3) = \\frac{1}{2}(3-2)^2 + 1 = 1.5. ## Step 6: Graph the Function ### Plot the vertex, axis of symmetry, and additional points on a coordinate plane.

            "text": "The best name for angle Y is \"exterior angle.\" Explanation In geometry, angles are often classified based on their position relative to a transversal and parallel lines. An exterior angle is formed outside the parallel lines, an alternate interior angle is formed between the parallel lines on opposite sides of the transversal, and an adjacent interior angle is directly next to another angle, sharing a common side and vertex. The best name for angle Y depends on its position relative to these lines and angles.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Type of Function ### The given function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{3}(x-2)^2 + 3 \\) is a quadratic function, which is a type of polynomial function. It represents a parabola. ## Step 2: Determine the Vertex ### The function is in vertex form \\( f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex. Here, \\( h = 2 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\), so the vertex is \\( (2, 3) \\). ## Step 3: Determine the Direction of the Parabola ### The coefficient \\( a = \\frac{1}{3} \\) is positive, indicating that the parabola opens upwards. ## Step 4: Determine the Axis of Symmetry ### The axis of symmetry is the vertical line \\( x = h \\), which is \\( x = 2 \\). ## Step 5: Plot Additional Points ### Choose values for \\( x \\) around the vertex to find additional points. For example, calculate \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(3) \\). - \\( f(1) = \\frac{1}{3}(1-2)^2 + 3 = \\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \\frac{10}{3} \\) - \\( f(3) = \\frac{1}{3}(3-2)^2 + 3 = \\frac{1}{3} + 3 = \\frac{10}{3} \\) ## Step 6: Sketch the Graph ### Plot the vertex and additional points, then draw the parabola opening upwards.",

No Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the distribution and parameters ### The average number of Facebook friends is normally distributed with a mean (\\mu) of 134 and a standard deviation (\\sigma) of 58. For a sample size (n) of 14, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is also normal with a mean of 134 and a standard deviation of \\frac{58}{\\sqrt{14}}. ## Step 2: Calculate the probability for part (a) ### To find the probability that the average number of friends is more than 112, calculate the z-score: z = \\frac{112 - 134}{\\frac{58}{\\sqrt{14}}}. Use the z-score to find the probability from the standard normal distribution table. ## Step 3: Calculate the third quartile for part (b) ### The third quartile (Q_3) corresponds to the 75th percentile. Use the z-score for the 75th percentile (approximately 0.674) and the formula Q_3 = \\mu + z \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} to find the third quartile. ## Step 4: Evaluate the necessity of normality for part (c) ### For part (a), the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal regardless of the original distribution, given a sufficiently large sample size. In this case, the assumption of normality is not strictly necessary.",

The remainder is 1, so the GCD of 2n+3 and n+1 is 1. ## Step 2: Solve part 8b by checking reducibility ### The fraction \\frac{8n+1}{20n+2} can be expressed as \\frac{8n+1}{2(10n+1)}. Since 8n+1 and 10n+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so the fraction cannot be reduced. ## Step 3: Solve part 9 by finding the least common multiple ### The least common multiple of 192 and 320 is \\frac{192 \\times 320}{\\text{GCD}(192, 320)}. The GCD is 64, so the LCM is 960. The first gear needs \\frac{960}{192} = 5 revolutions to realign. ## Step 4: Solve part 10 using the Chinese Remainder Theorem ### The number of gymnasts is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Differentiate this with respect to time \\( t \\) to relate the rates of change: \\( 2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\). ## Step 3: Differentiate the Area with Respect to Time ### Differentiate \\( A = \\frac{1}{2}xy \\) with respect to \\( t \\): \\( \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x \\frac{dy}{dt} + y \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right) \\). ## Step 4: Solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) ### From Step 2, solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} \\): \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{x}{y} \\frac{dx}{dt} \\). ## Step 5: Substitute and Calculate \\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\) ### Substitute \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} \\) into the differentiated area equation: \\( \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x \\left(-\\frac{x}{y} \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right) + y \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right) \\). ### Simplify: \\( \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{x^2}{y} \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{y^2 - x^2}{y} \\right) \\frac{dx}{dt} \\). ## Step 6: Evaluate at \\( x = 10 \\) ### At \\( x = 10 \\), use the Pythagorean theorem to find \\( y \\): \\( y = \\sqrt{L^2 - 10^2} \\). ### Substitute \\( x = 10 \\), \\( y = \\sqrt{L^2 - 100} \\), and \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\) (given or assumed) into the expression for \\( \\frac{dA}{dt} \\). ## Step 7: Interpret the Sign of \\(\\frac{dA}{dt}\\) ### The sign of \\( \\frac{dA}{dt} \\) indicates whether the area is increasing or decreasing. A positive sign means the area is increasing, and a negative sign means it is decreasing.",

However, the problem statement seems to have some inconsistencies, such as incorrect arithmetic.

So, the equation becomes 10000 = 4000e^{0.10t}. ## Step 3: Solve for t ### Divide both sides by 4000 to get 2.5 = e^{0.10t}. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for t: \\ln(2.5) = 0.10t. Therefore, t = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{0.10}. ## Step 4: Calculate the value of t ### Compute t = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{0.10} using a calculator to get the value to the nearest tenth.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the Range ### Calculate the range of the data by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. The range is 69 - 20 = 49. ## Step 2: Calculate Class Width ### Divide the range by the number of classes and round up to the nearest whole number. Class width = \\lceil \\frac{49}{5} \\rceil = 10. ## Step 3: Create Class Intervals ### Start at the minimum value and add the class width to create 5 intervals: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69. ## Step 4: Tally the Frequencies ### Count how many data points fall into each class interval: - 20-29: 2 - 30-39: 4 - 40-49: 8 - 50-59: 5 - 60-69: 4 ## Step 5: Determine the Shape of the Distribution ### Analyze the frequency distribution to determine its shape.

There are no local minima (other than possibly at points where the second derivative test is inconclusive.) ### Saddle points: B. There are no saddle points (other than possibly at points where the second derivative test is inconclusive.) Explanation ## Step 1: Find the first partial derivatives ### Calculate the first partial derivatives of the function f(x,y)=117+2xy-5x^{2}-5y^{2} with respect to x and y: - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2y - 10x - \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 2x - 10y ## Step 2: Set the first partial derivatives to zero ### Solve the equations \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0 and \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0 to find critical points: - 2y - 10x = 0 \\implies y = 5x - 2x - 10y = 0 \\implies x = 5y Solving these simultaneously, we get x = 0 and y = 0. Thus, the critical point is (0, 0). ## Step 3: Find the second partial derivatives ### Calculate the second partial derivatives: - \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = -10 - \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = -10 - \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 2 ## Step 4: Apply the Second-Derivative Test ### Use the second derivative test to classify the critical point (0, 0). Compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix D = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)^2: - D = (-10)(-10) - (2)^2 = 100 - 4 = 96 Since D > 0 and \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} < 0, the point (0, 0) is a local maximum. ## Step 5: Identify local minima and saddle points ### Since the test shows a local maximum, there are no local minima or saddle points at (0, 0).",

Here, a = 1, b = -6, so x = -\\frac{-6}{2 \\times 1} = 3. Substitute x = 3 into the equation to find y: y = 3^2 - 6 \\times 3 + 14 = 9 - 18 + 14 = 5. Thus, the vertex is (3, 5). ## Step 2: Find Points to the Left of the Vertex ### Choose x = 2 and x = 1. For x = 2: y = 2^2 - 6 \\times 2 + 14 = 4 - 12 + 14 = 6. For x = 1: y = 1^2 - 6 \\times 1 + 14 = 1 - 6 + 14 = 9. Points are (2, 6) and (1, 9). ## Step 3: Find Points to the Right of the Vertex ### Choose x = 4 and x = 5.

This means that as x increases, f(x) increases exponentially. ## Step2: Identify the point (0,1) ### To find the point (0,1) on the graph of f(x) = 2^x, substitute x = 0 into the function: f(0) = 2^0 = 1. Therefore, the point (0,1) is on the graph. ## Step3: Explore the significance of the point ### The point (0,1) is significant because it represents the y-intercept of the function. For exponential functions of the form f(x) = a^x, the y-intercept is always (0,1) when a^0 = 1.",

Swap x and y to get x = \\frac{9y-8}{2y+5}. Solve for y in terms of x. ## Step 2: Solve for y ### Multiply both sides by (2y+5) to eliminate the fraction: x(2y+5) = 9y-8. Expand and rearrange: 2xy + 5x = 9y - 8. Gather all terms involving y on one side: 2xy - 9y = -5x - 8. Factor out y: y(2x - 9) = -5x - 8. Solve for y: y = \\frac{-5x - 8}{2x - 9}. ## Step 3: Determine the domain of f^{-1} ### The domain of f^{-1}(x) is the range of f(x). Since f(x) = \\frac{9x-8}{2x+5}, the range is all real numbers except the value that makes the denominator zero. Solve 2x+5=0 to find the excluded value: x = -\\frac{5}{2}. Thus, the range of f(x) is \\mathbb{R}. ## Step 4: Determine the range of f^{-1} ### The range of f^{-1}(x) is the domain of f(x). The domain of f(x) is all real numbers except the value that makes the denominator zero. Solve 2x+5=0 to find the excluded value: x = -\\frac{5}{2}. Thus, the domain of f(x) is (-\\infty, -\\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (-\\frac{5}{2}, \\infty).",

Explanation A tessellation is a pattern of shapes that fit together without any gaps or overlaps. To determine if a pattern is a tessellation, we need to check if the shapes cover a plane completely without leaving any spaces. Regular tessellations are made using only one type of regular polygon, and the same number of polygons meet at each vertex. Semi-regular tessellations use more than one type of regular polygon, but they still have the same arrangement of polygons at each vertex. Irregular tessellations do not follow these rules and can be made of any shapes. Without the specific pattern provided, we cannot definitively categorize it, but these are the criteria to evaluate.",

            "text": "The template will form a cube if it consists of six squares arranged in a valid cube net configuration. Explanation To determine if a given template can form a cube when folded, we need to check if it consists of six squares arranged in a manner that allows them to form the six faces of a cube. A valid cube net must have exactly six squares, and they must be connected in a way that allows them to fold into a three-dimensional cube without overlapping or leaving gaps. Common cube nets include a cross shape or a T-shape. If the provided pattern does not match any of these configurations, it cannot form a cube.",

The theorem states: \\[ \\oint_{C} P \\, dx + Q \\, dy = \\iint_{S} \\left( \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} \\right) \\, dx \\, dy \\] For the given problem, \\( P = xy + 1 \\) and \\( Q = x^2 + y^2 \\). Thus, \\(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} = 2x\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = x\\). Therefore, the double integral becomes: \\[ \\iint_{S} (2x - x) \\, dx \\, dy = \\iint_{S} x \\, dx \\, dy \\] ## Step 2: Set up the Double Integral ### The region \\(S \\) is the triangle with vertices \\( (0,0) \\), \\( (1,0) \\), and \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right) \\). The limits for \\( y \\) are from 0 to 1, and for a fixed \\( y \\), \\( x \\) ranges from \\( \\frac{y}{2} \\) to \\( 1 - \\frac{y}{2} \\). Thus, the double integral is: \\[ \\int_{0}^{1} \\int_{y/2}^{1-y/2} x \\, dx \\, dy \\] ## Step 3: Evaluate the Inner Integral ### Evaluate the inner integral with respect to \\( x \\): \\[ \\int_{y/2}^{1-y/2} x \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{y/2}^{1-y/2} = \\frac{(1-y/2)^2}{2} - \\frac{(y/2)^2}{2} \\] Simplifying, we get: \\[ \\frac{1 - y + y^2/4}{2} - \\frac{y^2/4}{2} = \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\] ## Step 4: Evaluate the Outer Integral ### Now, evaluate the outer integral with respect to \\( y \\): \\[ \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\, dy = \\left[ \\frac{y}{2} - \\frac{y^2}{4} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]",

            "text": "### The vertex is (0, 6). The points to plot are (-1, 4), (-2, -2), (1, 4), and (2, -2). Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Vertex ### The vertex form of a parabola is y = a(x-h)^2 + k. Here, the equation is y = -2x^2 + 6, which is in the standard form y = ax^2 + bx + c. The vertex can be found using x = -\\frac{b}{2a}. Since b=0, the vertex is at x = 0. Substitute x = 0 into the equation to find y: y = -2(0)^2 + 6 = 6. Thus, the vertex is (0, 6). ## Step 2: Calculate Points to the Left of the Vertex ### Choose x = -1 and x = -2. Substitute into the equation: For x = -1, y = -2(-1)^2 + 6 = 4. For x = -2, y = -2(-2)^2 + 6 = -2. The points are (-1, 4) and (-2, -2). ## Step 3: Calculate Points to the Right of the Vertex ### Choose x = 1 and x = 2. Substitute into the equation: For x = 1, y = -2(1)^2 + 6 = 4. For x = 2, y = -2(2)^2 + 6 = -2. The points are (1, 4) and (2, -2). ## Step 4: Plot the Points and Graph the Parabola ### Plot the points (0, 6), (-1, 4), (-2, -2), (1, 4), and (2, -2) on a graph. Draw a smooth curve through these points to represent the parabola.",

The median (Q2) is the middle value, which is 3. The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the first half: \\{-9, -6, 1, 3\\}, which is (-6 + 1)/2 = -2.5. The upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the second half: \\{3, 4, 6, 7\\}, which is (4 + 6)/2 = 5. The IQR is Q3 - Q1 = 5 - (-2.5) = 7.5.",

For \\(L_1\\), the points are \\((-2, -1)\\) and \\((1, 11)\\).

Thus, the slope \\(m_2 = \\frac{4 - 2}{9 - 1} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\\). ## Step 3: Determine the relationship between the slopes ### Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal, and perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \\(-1\\).

            "text": "### a = 2, b = 2; A \\cup B = \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\} Explanation ## Step 1: Identify common elements in sets A and B ### Given that A \\cap B = \\{4, 7\\}, identify elements that must be in both sets. Since 7 is already in set A, a^2 must be 4. ## Step 2: Solve for a ### Since a^2 = 4, solve for a. The solutions are a = 2 or a = -2. ## Step 3: Determine elements in set B ### With a = 2 or a = -2, substitute into set B. If a = 2, then a+1 = 3 and ab = 2b. If a = -2, then a+1 = -1 and ab = -2b. ## Step 4: Determine b using A \\cap B = \\{4, 7\\} ### For a = 2, ab = 2b must be 4 to be in A \\cap B. Thus, 2b = 4, so b = 2. For a = -2, ab = -2b cannot be 4, so a = -2 is not valid. ## Step 5: Find A \\cup B ### With a = 2 and b = 2, A = \\{3, 7, 4\\} and B = \\{2, 4, 3, 4\\}. Thus, A \\cup B = \\{2, 3, 4, 7\\}.",

The derivative will help us identify critical points and intervals of increase or decrease. ## Step2: Find critical points ### Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x to find critical points. These points will help determine where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. ## Step3: Test intervals around critical points ### Use test points in the intervals defined by the critical points to determine the sign of the derivative. If the derivative is positive in an interval, the function is increasing there; if negative, it is decreasing. ## Step4: Determine intervals of increase and decrease ### Based on the sign of the derivative in each interval, identify where the function is increasing or decreasing.",

The parabola opens downward and has a maximum value of 20.5 ### (c) The range of f(x) is (-\\infty, 20.5] ### (d) The function is increasing on (-\\infty, 7) and decreasing on (7, \\infty) Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the vertex of the parabola The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. For the given function f(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 7x - 4, we can use the formula for the vertex h = -\\frac{b}{2a} where a = -\\frac{1}{2} and b = 7. Calculating gives h = -\\frac{7}{2(-\\frac{1}{2})} = 7. Substituting x = 7 back into the function gives f(7) = -\\frac{1}{2}(7)^2 + 7(7) - 4 = 20.5. Therefore, the vertex is (7, 20.5). ## Step 2: Determine if there is a maximum or minimum value Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (a = -\\frac{1}{2}), the parabola opens downward, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. Thus, the maximum value is 20.5. ## Step 3: Find the range of the function Since the parabola opens downward and has a maximum value of 20.5, the range of the function is (-\\infty, 20.5]. ## Step 4: Determine intervals of increase and decrease The function is increasing on the interval (-\\infty, 7) and decreasing on the interval (7, \\infty) because the vertex at x = 7 is the maximum point.",

Substituting a = -\\frac{1}{2} and b = 7, we find x = -\\frac{7}{2(-\\frac{1}{2})} = 7. The y-coordinate of the vertex is f(7) = -\\frac{1}{2}(7)^2 + 7(7) - 4 = 20.5. Thus, the vertex is (7, 20.5). ## Step 3: Determine maximum or minimum ### Since a = -\\frac{1}{2} is negative, the parabola opens downward, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. ## Step 4: Find the range ### The maximum value of the function is 20.5, so the range is (-\\infty, 20.5]. ## Step 5: Determine intervals of increase and decrease ### The function is increasing on the interval (-\\infty, 7) and decreasing on the interval (7, \\infty).",

Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the equation gives \\( y = 3 \\). So, the y-intercept is \\( (0, 3) \\). ## Step2: Determine the slope ### The slope of the line is the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the equation, which is 2. This means for every unit increase in \\( x \\), \\( y \\) increases by 2 units. ## Step3: Plot a second point using the slope ### Starting from the y-intercept \\( (0, 3) \\), use the slope to find a second point. Since the slope is 2, move 1 unit to the right (increase \\( x \\) by 1) and 2 units up (increase \\( y \\) by 2). This gives the point \\( (1, 5) \\).",

            "text": "### Isaiah is incorrect because 0s do not indicate 10 as a factor. Explanation ## Step 1: Analyze the Number ### The number 1,040 can be expressed in terms of its prime factors. We need to determine if 10 can be a factor twice. ## Step 2: Prime Factorization ### Perform the prime factorization of 1,040. Start by dividing by 2, the smallest prime number: \\[ 1,040 \\div 2 = 520 \\\\ 520 \\div 2 = 260 \\\\ 260 \\div 2 = 130 \\\\ 130 \\div 2 = 65 \\] 65 is not divisible by 2, so we proceed with the next smallest prime, 5: \\[ 65 \\div 5 = 13 \\] 13 is a prime number. Thus, the prime factorization of 1,040 is \\(2^4 \\times 5 \\times 13\\). ## Step 3: Determine if 10 is a Factor ### The number 10 is composed of the prime factors 2 and 5. We have four 2's and one 5 in the factorization of 1,040, so 10 can be a factor once, but not twice (as it would require two 5's).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Define the Hypotheses ### The null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) states that the population standard deviation is equal to 0.006. The alternative hypothesis \\( H_1 \\) states that the population standard deviation is less than 0.006. ## Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic ### Use the chi-square test statistic formula for variance: \\( x^2 = \\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\\sigma^2} \\), where \\( n = 23 \\), \\( s = 0.0052 \\), and \\( \\sigma = 0.006 \\). ### Calculate: \\( x^2 = \\frac{(23-1)(0.0052)^2}{(0.006)^2} \\). ### Simplify: \\( x^2 = \\frac{22 \\times 0.00002704}{0.000036} \\). ### Result: \\( x^2 = 16.528 \\) (rounded to three decimal places). ## Step 3: Determine the P-value ### Use a chi-square distribution table or technology to find the P-value for \\( x^2 = 16.528 \\) with 22 degrees of freedom. ### Result: The P-value is approximately 0.276 (rounded to three decimal places).",

Given x = 3 and y = 4, x > y is false, so !(x > y) is true. ## Step 2: Evaluate the expression (y + z) > m(x - z) ### Substitute y = 4, z = 2, and x = 3. The expression becomes (4 + 2) > m(3 - 2). Simplifying, 6 > m(1), which depends on the value of m. ## Step 3: Determine the logical operation ### The logical operation is \"11\", which seems to be a typo or error. Assuming it is a logical operator, we need clarification. If it is an AND operation, both conditions must be true. If it is an OR operation, at least one must be true. ## Step 4: Assign the result ### Without the correct logical operation, we cannot definitively assign the result. Assuming AND, the result is false because the second condition depends on m. Assuming OR, the result is true because the first condition is true.",
