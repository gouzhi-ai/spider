We set up the long division with (x^3 + x^2 - 14x + 1) as the dividend and (x+4) as the divisor. ## Step 2: Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. \\(x^3 \\div x = x^2\\) Multiply this result by the divisor: \\(x^2(x+4) = x^3 + 4x^2\\) Subtract this result from the dividend: \\((x^3 + x^2 - 14x + 1) - (x^3 + 4x^2) = -3x^2 - 14x + 1\\) ## Step 3: Bring down the next term. Bring down the next term from the dividend, which is -14x. We now have -3x^2 - 14x + 1. ## Step 4: Divide the leading term of the new dividend by the leading term of the divisor. \\(-3x^2 \\div x = -3x\\) Multiply this result by the divisor: \\(-3x(x+4) = -3x^2 - 12x\\) Subtract this result from the current dividend: \\((-3x^2 - 14x + 1) - (-3x^2 - 12x) = -2x + 1\\) ## Step 5: Bring down the next term. Bring down the next term from the dividend, which is 1. We now have -2x + 1. ## Step 6: Divide the leading term of the new dividend by the leading term of the divisor. \\(-2x \\div x = -2\\) Multiply this result by the divisor: \\(-2(x+4) = -2x - 8\\) Subtract this result from the current dividend: \\((-2x + 1) - (-2x - 8) = 9\\) ## Step 7: Identify the quotient and remainder. The quotient is x^2 - 3x - 2 and the remainder is 9.",

            "text": "### The graph of the equation y = x + 3 is a straight line passing through the points (0, 3) and (1, 4). Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Equation ### The given equation is y = x + 3. This is a linear equation in slope-intercept form, where the slope m is 1 and the y-intercept b is 3. ## Step 2: Identify Key Points ### To graph this equation, we need to identify key points on the Cartesian coordinate system. We can start by finding the y-intercept and then use the slope to find another point. ### The y-intercept occurs when x = 0. Substituting x = 0 into the equation: \\[ y = 0 + 3 = 3 \\] ### So, the y-intercept is at the point (0, 3). ## Step 3: Use the Slope to Find Another Point ### The slope m = 1 means that for every unit increase in x, y increases by 1 unit. Starting from the y-intercept (0, 3), if we increase x by 1, y will also increase by 1: \\[ \\text{When } x = 1, \\quad y = 1 + 3 = 4 \\] ### So, another point on the line is (1, 4). ## Step 4: Plot the Points ### On the Cartesian coordinate system: - Plot the point (0, 3). - Plot the point (1, 4). ## Step 5: Draw the Line ### Connect these two points with a straight line. Extend the line in both directions to cover the entire graph.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Determine if the equation defines a function ### The equation y = 10x is a linear equation, which means for every value of x, there is exactly one corresponding value of y. Therefore, it defines y as a function of x. ## Step 2: Identify the domain of the function ### Since the equation y = 10x is a linear function, x can take any real number. Thus, the domain of the function is all real numbers, represented in interval notation as (-\\infty, \\infty).",

            "text": "### The truck has enough soil to completely fill 16 planters. Explanation ## Step 1: Convert Gallons to Cubic Yards ### First, we need to convert the volume of soil from gallons to cubic yards. There are 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot, and there are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. Therefore, the conversion factor from gallons to cubic yards is \\(\\frac{1}{7.48052 \\times 27}\\). ## Step 2: Calculate Total Cubic Yards ### Using the conversion factor, calculate the total cubic yards of soil available by multiplying 2500 gallons by the conversion factor. ## Step 3: Determine Number of Planters ### Each planter requires 2 cubic yards of soil. Divide the total cubic yards of soil by 2 to find out how many planters can be filled.",

            "text": "To answer this question, we need to consider the historical context of European colonization in Africa. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers colonized much of Africa. The primary motivations for colonization were economic gain, national prestige, and the belief in European superiority, often referred to as the \"White Man's Burden.\"Now, let's analyze the options provided:A. It was their right to take what they wanted.B. It was a necessity for their countries to survive.C. It was a way to preserve traditional African economies.D. It was a way to protect Africans from the Industrial Revolution.Option A reflects the imperialistic attitude that European powers had, which included a sense of entitlement to the resources of the lands they colonized.Option B suggests that European countries felt that exploiting African resources was essential for their own national survival, which aligns with the economic motivations for colonization.Option C is not consistent with historical facts, as European colonization often disrupted traditional African economies rather than preserving them.Option D is incorrect because the protection of Africans from the Industrial Revolution was not a concern of European colonizers; rather, they were interested in exploiting African resources to fuel their own industrialization.Considering the historical context and motivations for colonization, the most accurate answer would be:**A. It was their right to take what they wanted.**This option best reflects the imperialistic mindset of the time, where European colonizers often justified their exploitation of resources as a natural right stemming from their perceived superiority.",

Half of this is 2, and squaring it gives 4. We add and subtract 4 inside the parentheses: \\[ y = (x^2 + 4x + 4) - 45 - 4 \\] ## Step 4: Simplify the expression. This simplifies to: \\[ y = (x + 2)^2 - 49 \\] ## Step 5: Identify the missing step.

Explanation (a) Percentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within a dataset. The 24th percentile means that 24% of the data is below this value, and the 77th percentile means 77% of the data is below this value. Therefore, the Walker family earns more than the Reed family because they are at a higher percentile. (b) Being at the 24th percentile means that 24% of families earn less than the Reed family, and consequently, 76% earn more. This does not relate to the percentage of the highest income in the county.",

For a triangle with sides a, b, and c (where c is the longest side), if a^2 + b^2 = c^2, it is a right triangle. If a^2 + b^2 > c^2, it is an acute triangle, and if a^2 + b^2 < c^2, it is an obtuse triangle. Here, the sides are 6, 20, and 22, with 22 being the longest side. ### Calculate 6^2 + 20^2 = 36 + 400 = 436 and compare it to 22^2 = 484. Since 436 < 484, the triangle is obtuse.",

This is a linear equation in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. ## Step 2: Identify the Slope and Y-Intercept ### From the equation y = 4x - 3, we identify: - Slope (m) = 4 - Y-intercept (b) = -3 ## Step 3: Plot the Y-Intercept ### The line crosses the y-axis at the point (0, -3). ## Step 4: Use the Slope to Find Another Point ### The slope of 4 means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 4 units. Starting from (0, -3), if x increases by 1, then y becomes -3 + 4 = 1. Thus, another point on the line is (1, 1). ## Step 5: Determine the Correct Graph ### We need to find a graph that passes through the points (0, -3) and (1, 1) with a positive slope of 4. ## Step 6: Compare with Given Options ### Let's compare these points with the descriptions of the graphs provided: - **Picture 1**: Passes through (-1, 0) and (0, 3) with a positive slope. - **Picture 2**: Passes through (0, -3) and (1, 1) with a positive slope. - **Picture 3**: Passes through (-1, 0) and (0, -3) with a negative slope. - **Picture 4**: Passes through (0, 3) and (1, -1) with a negative slope. ### Picture 2 matches our calculated points (0, -3) and (1, 1) with a positive slope.",

To find the explicit formula, we first need to determine if it is an arithmetic or geometric sequence. Since each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, this is a geometric sequence. ## Step 2: Determine the common ratio ### To find the common ratio, divide any term by its preceding term. For example, \\frac{17.5}{3.5} = 5. This ratio is consistent throughout the sequence, confirming that the common ratio is 5. ## Step 3: Identify the first term ### The first term of the sequence is 3.5. ## Step 4: Use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence ### The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is g_n = a \\cdot r^{n-1}, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

The dividend is -9q^2 + 77q + 46, and the divisor is q - 9. ## Step 2: Divide the Leading Terms ### Divide the leading term of the dividend, -9q^2, by the leading term of the divisor, q. This gives -9q. Multiply the entire divisor by -9q and subtract from the dividend. ## Step 3: Subtract and Bring Down ### After subtraction, bring down the next term from the original dividend to form a new polynomial. Repeat the process with the new leading term. ## Step 4: Continue the Process ### Continue dividing the new leading term by the leading term of the divisor, multiplying, and subtracting until all terms are processed. ## Step 5: Identify the Remainder ### If there is any leftover term after processing all terms, this is the remainder. Express it as a fraction over the divisor.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Functions ### We have four exponential functions to consider: - y = 5^x: This is a monotonically increasing function that passes through points like (-1, \\frac{1}{5}), (0, 1), and (1, 5). As x \\to -\\infty, y \\to 0. - y = 4^x: This is also a monotonically increasing function passing through (0, 1) and (1, 4). As x \\to -\\infty, y \\to 0. - y = 5^{-x}: This is a monotonically decreasing function that passes through (0, 1) and (-1, 5). As x \\to \\infty, y \\to 0. - y = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x: This is equivalent to y = 3^{-x}, a monotonically decreasing function passing through (0, 1). As x \\to \\infty, y \\to 0. ## Step 2: Identify Intersection Points ### All functions intersect at the point (0, 1) because for any base a > 0, a^0 = 1. ## Step 3: Sketch the Curves ### On a Cartesian coordinate system: - **Solid Curve**: Draw y = 5^x, starting from below the x-axis on the left and rising steeply as it moves right. - **Dashed Curve**: Draw y = 4^x, similar to y = 5^x but less steep. - **Dotted Curve**: Draw y = 5^{-x}, starting high on the left and decreasing towards the x-axis as it moves right. - **Another Dotted Curve**: Draw y = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x, which behaves similarly to y = 5^{-x}. ## Step 4: Label the Curves ### Ensure each curve is labeled correctly: - Solid line for y = 5^x - Dashed line for y = 4^x - Dotted line for y = 5^{-x} - Another dotted line for y = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^x",

            "text": "4.69 Explanation To find the value of \\(f(2e^4)\\) for the function \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\), we need to evaluate the natural logarithm of \\(2e^4\\). The natural logarithm, denoted as \\(\\ln\\), is the logarithm to the base \\(e\\), where \\(e\\) is Euler's number, approximately equal to 2.71828. The given function is \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\). We need to substitute \\(x\\) with \\(2e^4\\) and evaluate the logarithm. The logarithmic property we use here is that \\(\\ln(ab) = \\ln a + \\ln b\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are any positive real numbers. Applying this property: 1. Substitute \\(x\\) with \\(2e^4\\) in \\(f(x)\\), we get \\(f(2e^4) = \\ln(2e^4)\\). 2. Applying the logarithmic property, this becomes \\(\\ln 2 + \\ln e^4\\). 3. \\(\\ln e^4\\) simplifies to \\(4\\) since \\(\\ln e^n = n\\), where \\(n\\) is any real number. 4. Therefore, \\(f(2e^4) = \\ln 2 + 4\\). Now, we just need to find the value of \\(\\ln 2\\) and add it to 4. The approximate value of \\(\\ln 2\\) is about 0.693. Adding this to 4 gives: \\(\\ln 2 + 4 \\approx 0.693 + 4 = 4.693\\). Since the question asks to round to the nearest hundredth, the final answer is 4.69.",

Specifically, the second equation is three times the first equation: \\[ 24x + 21y = 3(8x + 7y) = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\] ## Step 3: Solve the first equation for \\( y \\) To find the relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), solve the first equation for \\( y \\): \\[ 8x + 7y = 9 \\] \\[ 7y = 9 - 8x \\] \\[ y = \\frac{9 - 8x}{7} \\] \\[ y = -\\frac{8x}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\] ## Step 4: Compare with the given options We need to find which of the given points satisfies the equation \\( y = -\\frac{8x}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\). ### Option A: \\( (r, -\\frac{8r}{7} + \\frac{9}{7}) \\) Substitute \\( x = r \\) into the equation: \\[ y = -\\frac{8r}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\] This matches the given point, so Option A is correct. ### Option B: \\( (-\\frac{6r}{7} + \\frac{9}{7}, r) \\) Substitute \\( x = -\\frac{6r}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\) into the equation: \\[ y = -\\frac{8}{7} \\left( -\\frac{6r}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\right) + \\frac{9}{7} \\] \\[ y = \\frac{48r}{49} - \\frac{72}{49} + \\frac{9}{7} \\] This does not simplify to \\( r \\), so Option B is incorrect. ### Option C: \\( (-\\frac{8r}{7} + 9, \\frac{8r}{7} + 27) \\) Substitute \\( x = -\\frac{8r}{7} + 9 \\) into the equation: \\[ y = -\\frac{8}{7} \\left( -\\frac{8r}{7} + 9 \\right) + \\frac{9}{7} \\] \\[ y = \\frac{64r}{49} - \\frac{72}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\] This does not simplify to \\( \\frac{8r}{7} + 27 \\), so Option C is incorrect. ### Option D: \\( (\\frac{r}{3} + 9, -\\frac{r}{3} + 27) \\) Substitute \\( x = \\frac{r}{3} + 9 \\) into the equation: \\[ y = -\\frac{8}{7} \\left( \\frac{r}{3} + 9 \\right) + \\frac{9}{7} \\] \\[ y = -\\frac{8r}{21} - \\frac{72}{7} + \\frac{9}{7} \\] This does not simplify to \\( -\\frac{r}{3} + 27 \\), so Option D is incorrect.",

The derivative is y' = 4e^x. ## Step 3: Evaluate the derivative at x = 3 ### Substitute x = 3 into the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line at this point. This gives y' = 4e^3. ## Step 4: Write the equation of the tangent line ### Use the point-slope form of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is the point on the line. Here, m = 4e^3, x_1 = 3, and y_1 = 4e^3. Thus, the equation is y - 4e^3 = 4e^3(x - 3).",

            "text": "The solution to the system of equations is \\((x, y, z) = (7, 9, -3)\\). Explanation ## Step 1: Write down the system of equations. We are given the following system of linear equations: \\[ \\begin{cases} 3x + 2y - 5z = 54 \\\\ -x + 4y + 8z = 5 \\\\ 7x - 2y + 8z = 7 \\end{cases} \\] ## Step 2: Use the elimination method to eliminate one variable. First, we will eliminate \\(x\\) from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 7 and the third equation by 1: \\[ \\begin{cases} -7x + 28y + 56z = 35 \\\\ 7x - 2y + 8z = 7 \\end{cases} \\] Add these two equations to eliminate \\(x\\): \\[ (-7x + 28y + 56z) + (7x - 2y + 8z) = 35 + 7 \\\\ 26y + 64z = 42 \\] Simplify: \\[ 13y + 32z = 21 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)} \\] ## Step 3: Eliminate \\(x\\) from the first and third equations. Multiply the first equation by 7 and the third equation by 3: \\[ \\begin{cases} 21x + 14y - 35z = 378 \\\\ 21x - 6y + 24z = 21 \\end{cases} \\] Subtract the third equation from the first to eliminate \\(x\\): \\[ (21x + 14y - 35z) - (21x - 6y + 24z) = 378 - 21 \\\\ 20y - 59z = 357 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)} \\] ## Step 4: Solve the system of two equations in two variables. We now have: \\[ \\begin{cases} 13y + 32z = 21 \\\\ 20y - 59z = 357 \\end{cases} \\] Multiply the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 13: \\[ \\begin{cases} 260y + 640z = 420 \\\\ 260y - 767z = 4641 \\end{cases} \\] Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\(y\\): \\[ (260y + 640z) - (260y - 767z) = 420 - 4641 \\\\ 1407z = -4221 \\\\ z = -3 \\] ## Step 5: Substitute \\(z\\) back into one of the equations to find \\(y\\). Substitute \\(z = -3\\) into Equation 4: \\[ 13y + 32(-3) = 21 \\\\ 13y - 96 = 21 \\\\ 13y = 117 \\\\ y = 9 \\] ## Step 6: Substitute \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(x\\). Substitute \\(y = 9\\) and \\(z = -3\\) into the first original equation: \\[ 3x + 2(9) - 5(-3) = 54 \\\\ 3x + 18 + 15 = 54 \\\\ 3x + 33 = 54 \\\\ 3x = 21 \\\\ x = 7 \\]",

The vertex of the parabola is at the origin, and the dish's opening is 12 feet across, meaning it spans from x = -6 to x = 6. At the center (vertex), the depth is 2 feet. ## Step2: Determine the Constant 'a' ### Using the point (6, 2) on the parabola, substitute into the equation y = ax^2: 2 = a(6)^2. Solving for a, we get a = \\frac{1}{18}. ## Step3: Find the Focus of the Parabola ### The focus of a parabola y = ax^2 is located at (0, \\frac{1}{4a}).

            "text": "### \\(x = 10^\\circ\\) Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration ### We have a right-angled triangle with vertices at the bottom left, top left, and bottom right. The right angle is at the bottom left vertex. The interior angle at the bottom right vertex is given as \\(20^\\circ\\). ## Step 2: Identify Key Points and Lines ### A point on the bottom edge (let's call it \\(P\\)) is connected to the top left vertex (let's call it \\(A\\)) by a line segment \\(AP\\). This line segment is equal in length to the distance from \\(P\\) to the bottom right vertex (let's call it \\(B\\)). Therefore, \\(AP = PB\\). ## Step 3: Analyze the Isosceles Triangle ### Since \\(AP = PB\\), triangle \\(APB\\) is isosceles with \\(AP = PB\\). The angle at \\(B\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\), so the angles at \\(A\\) and \\(P\\) must be equal. ## Step 4: Calculate the Angles in Triangle APB ### In any triangle, the sum of the angles is \\(180^\\circ\\). Thus, for triangle \\(APB\\): \\[ \\angle A + \\angle P + \\angle B = 180^\\circ \\] Given that \\(\\angle B = 20^\\circ\\), we have: \\[ \\angle A + \\angle P + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\] Since \\(\\angle A = \\angle P\\), let \\(\\angle A = \\angle P = y\\). Then: \\[ 2y + 20^\\circ = 180^\\circ \\] Solving for \\(y\\): \\[ 2y = 160^\\circ \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 80^\\circ \\] ## Step 5: Determine the Angle x ### The angle \\(x\\) is the angle between the connecting line \\(AP\\) and the vertical left edge. Since \\(\\angle A = 80^\\circ\\) and the entire angle at the top left vertex is \\(90^\\circ\\) (as it's part of the right-angled triangle), we find: \\[ x = 90^\\circ - 80^\\circ = 10^\\circ \\]",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Slope and Y-Intercept ### The given linear equation is y = 4x + 5. This equation is in the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept. Here, the slope m = 4 and the y-intercept b = 5. ## Step 2: Plot the Y-Intercept ### The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. For the equation y = 4x + 5, the y-intercept is at (0, 5). On the Cartesian coordinate system, plot the point (0, 5) on the y-axis. ## Step 3: Use the Slope to Determine Another Point ### The slope of the line is 4, which can be expressed as a fraction \\frac{4}{1}. This means that for every increase of 1 unit in the x-direction (right), the y-value increases by 4 units (up). Starting from the y-intercept (0, 5), move 1 unit to the right to x = 1, then move 4 units up to reach the point (1, 9). ## Step 4: Draw the Line ### With the points (0, 5) and (1, 9) plotted, draw a straight line through these points. Extend the line across the graph to cover the visible area of the Cartesian plane.",

The given polynomial is \\(x^2 - 19x + 84\\). ## Step 2: Determine the factors of the constant term. The constant term is 84. We need to find two numbers that multiply to 84 and add up to the coefficient of the middle term, which is -19. ## Step 3: Find the pair of numbers that satisfy the conditions. The pairs of factors of 84 are: - \\(1 \\times 84\\) - \\(2 \\times 42\\) - \\(3 \\times 28\\) - \\(4 \\times 21\\) - \\(6 \\times 14\\) - \\(7 \\times 12\\) Among these pairs, the pair that adds up to -19 is -7 and -12 because: \\[ -7 + (-12) = -19 \\] ## Step 4: Write the factored form of the polynomial. Using the numbers -7 and -12, we can write the polynomial as: \\[ x^2 - 19x + 84 = (x - 7)(x - 12) \\] ## Step 5: Identify the correct factor from the given options. From the factored form \\((x - 7)(x - 12)\\), we see that \\((x - 12)\\) is one of the factors.",

For this piecewise function, we only need to integrate from 0 to 5 because \\( f(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t \\geq 5 \\). ## Step3: Calculate the Integral ### Compute the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{5} e^{-st} \\cdot 4 \\, dt \\). This simplifies to \\( 4 \\int_{0}^{5} e^{-st} \\, dt \\). ## Step4: Solve the Integral ### The integral \\( \\int e^{-st} \\, dt \\) is solved as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\int e^{-st} \\, dt &= -\\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} + C \\end{aligned} \\] ### Applying the limits from 0 to 5: \\[ \\begin{aligned} 4 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{s} e^{-st} \\right]_{0}^{5} &= 4 \\left( -\\frac{1}{s} e^{-5s} + \\frac{1}{s} e^{0} \\right) \\\\ &= 4 \\left( -\\frac{1}{s} e^{-5s} + \\frac{1}{s} \\right) \\\\ &= 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s} e^{-5s} \\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{4}{s} (1 - e^{-5s}) \\end{aligned} \\]",

To find the inverse, we need a function that reverses this mapping, i.e., maps f(x) back to x. ## Step2: Analyze the Given Options ### We need to identify which option correctly maps the outputs of the original function back to their respective inputs. This means checking if the pairs in each option reverse the mapping of the original function. ## Step3: Verify Each Option ### Check each option to see if it correctly reverses the mapping from f(x) to x. The correct inverse will have pairs such that the first element is an output of the original function, and the second element is the corresponding input.",

Therefore, the domain is \\( [1, \\infty) \\). ## Step 3: Determine the Range ### The range of \\( y = \\sqrt{x - 1} \\) is all real numbers \\( y \\) such that \\( y \\geq 0 \\). This is because the square root function only produces non-negative outputs. Therefore, the range is \\( [0, \\infty) \\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Calculate the slope of Line 1 ### The slope \\( m \\) of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is given by the formula: \\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\] For Line 1, the points are \\((4, 13)\\) and \\((2, 9)\\). Plugging these into the formula: \\[ m_1 = \\frac{9 - 13}{2 - 4} = \\frac{-4}{-2} = 2 \\] So, the slope of Line 1 is \\( m_1 = 2 \\). ## Step 2: Calculate the slope of Line 2 ### Using the same formula, for Line 2 with points \\((-4, -1)\\) and \\((0, 7)\\): \\[ m_2 = \\frac{7 - (-1)}{0 - (-4)} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\] So, the slope of Line 2 is \\( m_2 = 2 \\). ## Step 3: Determine the relationship between the lines ### Since both lines have the same slope (\\( m_1 = m_2 = 2 \\)), they are parallel.",

The minimum value means that the diver reaches a maximum depth of 22 units below the surface of the water. Explanation ## Step 1: Convert the quadratic function to vertex form ### The given quadratic function is \\( f(x) = x^2 - 10x + 3 \\). To convert it to vertex form, we complete the square. ## Step 2: Completing the square ### We rewrite the function as \\( f(x) = (x^2 - 10x) + 3 \\). To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is \\(-10\\), divide by 2 to get \\(-5\\), and then square it to get \\(25\\). Adding and subtracting \\(25\\) inside the function, we get \\( f(x) = (x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 + 3 \\). ## Step 3: Simplify the expression ### This simplifies to \\( f(x) = (x - 5)^2 - 22 \\). This is the vertex form of the quadratic function. ## Step 4: Identify the vertex ### The vertex form \\( f(x) = (x - h)^2 + k \\) gives us the vertex at \\( (h, k) \\). Here, \\( h = 5 \\) and \\( k = -22 \\). Therefore, the vertex is at \\( (5, -22) \\). ## Step 5: Interpret the minimum value ### The minimum value of the function is \\(-22\\), which represents the diver's maximum depth in the water. This is because the vertex of the parabola represents the lowest point on the graph, corresponding to the diver's deepest point in the water.",

            "text": "### C. H_{0}:\\mu =11.0, H_{a},\\mu \\lt 11.0 Explanation ## Step1: Define the Claim and Hypotheses ### The dean claims that the mean number of classroom hours per week for full-time faculty is 11.0. This can be expressed mathematically as \\mu = 11.0. For hypothesis testing, we set up the null hypothesis (H_0) as the claim: H_0: \\mu = 11.0. The alternative hypothesis (H_a) represents the opposite of the claim, which in this context would be that the mean is not equal to 11.0: H_a: \\mu \\neq 11.0. ## Step2: Identify Correct Hypothesis Option ### Among the given options, the correct representation of the hypotheses is: C. H_{0}:\\mu =11.0, H_{a},\\mu \\lt 11.0. However, since the problem asks if you can reject the dean's claim at \\alpha = 0.01, the appropriate alternative hypothesis should reflect a two-tailed test: H_a: \\mu \\neq 11.0. ## Step3: Calculate the P-value ### To find the P-value, use technology (such as statistical software or a calculator) to perform a t-test on the sample data provided. The P-value will indicate the probability of observing the sample data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.",

We label each branch with the corresponding probabilities. ## Step 3: Calculate Probabilities ### Using the data from the two-way table, we calculate each probability as requested. 1. **P(Outside \\cap Tag)**: The probability that a child is playing outside and playing tag is \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15. 2. **P(Outside \\cup Tag)**: The probability that a child is playing outside or playing tag is \\frac{76 + 33 - 15}{100} = \\frac{94}{100} = 0.94. 3. **P(Inside)**: The probability that a child is playing inside is \\frac{24}{100} = 0.24. 4. **P(Outside^C \\cap Tag)**: The probability that a child is not playing outside and playing tag is \\frac{18}{100} = 0.18. 5. **P(Tag)**: The probability that a child is playing tag is \\frac{33}{100} = 0.33. 6. **P(Inside \\cap Not Play Tag)**: The probability that a child is playing inside and not playing tag is \\frac{6}{100} = 0.06. 7. **P(Inside \\cup Tag^C)**: The probability that a child is playing inside or not playing tag is \\frac{24 + 67 - 6}{100} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85. 8. **P(Inside \\cup Tag)**: The probability that a child is playing inside or playing tag is \\frac{24 + 33 - 18}{100} = \\frac{39}{100} = 0.39.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Analyze the Slope of the Regression Line ### The slope of the least squares regression line is \\(-0.496\\). This indicates that for each additional year of age, the percentage of fatal accidents due to speeding decreases by approximately 0.496%. A negative slope suggests a negative correlation between age and the percentage of fatal accidents due to speeding. ## Step 2: Evaluate the Correlation ### Since the slope is negative, the correlation between the age of a driver and the percentage of all fatal accidents due to speeding is also negative. This aligns with option (A). ## Step 3: Assess Other Options ### Option (B) suggests a strong positive relationship, which contradicts the negative slope. Option (C) incorrectly interprets the decrease as a probability rather than a percentage change. Option (D) is incorrect because the likelihood decreases with age.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding Congruence ### Two figures are congruent if they have the same shape and size, but their positions or orientations may differ. Transformations that preserve congruence include reflections, rotations, and translations. ## Step 2: Analyzing Sequence 1 ### Sequence 1 involves a reflection over the line \\( y = -x \\) followed by a translation of 8 units up and 2 units right. Reflections and translations are rigid transformations that preserve congruence. ## Step 3: Analyzing Sequence 2 ### Sequence 2 involves translating the figure down 10 units and then rotating it \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) clockwise about the origin. Both translation and rotation are rigid transformations, thus preserving congruence. ## Step 4: Analyzing Sequence 3 ### Sequence 3 involves reflecting the figure across the \\( x \\)-axis and then rotating it \\( 180^{\\circ} \\) clockwise about the origin. Reflection and rotation are rigid transformations, preserving congruence. ## Step 5: Analyzing Sequence 4 ### Sequence 4 involves rotating the figure \\( 90^{\\circ} \\) counterclockwise about the origin and then translating it 2 units right. Rotation and translation are rigid transformations, preserving congruence. ## Step 6: Identifying Sequences That Prove Congruence ### All sequences involve rigid transformations, which means any sequence can be used to prove congruence between Figure 1 and Figure 2. However, the question asks for two sequences.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the Problem ### We are given a table showing the depreciation of a car's value over time. The task is to find an exponential regression equation that models this data and then use it to predict the car's value after 12 years. ## Step 2: Formulating the Exponential Regression Equation ### An exponential regression equation generally takes the form \\( y = ab^x \\), where \\( a \\) is the initial value (when \\( x = 0 \\)), and \\( b \\) is the base of the exponential function representing the rate of change. Here, \\( a = 15600 \\). ## Step 3: Calculating the Base \\( b \\) ### To find \\( b \\), we can use the least squares method for exponential regression. However, for simplicity, let's assume the decay follows a consistent pattern. We can estimate \\( b \\) by using two points from the data, such as when \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\): \\[ b = \\left(\\frac{y_5}{y_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}} = \\left(\\frac{7865}{15600}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}} \\] ## Step 4: Solving for \\( b \\) ### Calculate \\( b \\): \\[ b = \\left(\\frac{7865}{15600}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}} \\approx 0.88 \\] Thus, the approximate exponential regression equation is: \\[ y = 15600 \\times 0.88^x \\] ## Step 5: Predicting the Value After 12 Years ### Using the equation \\( y = 15600 \\times 0.88^x \\), substitute \\( x = 12 \\): \\[ y = 15600 \\times 0.88^{12} \\] ## Step 6: Calculating the Value ### Compute the value: \\[ y \\approx 15600 \\times 0.278 \\approx 4337.28 \\]",

Explanation ## Step 1: Define the Variables ### Let x be the number of bags of feed type A and y be the number of bags of feed type B. ## Step 2: Formulate the Objective Function ### The objective is to minimize the cost. The cost function can be expressed as C = 3x + 2y, where 3x is the cost for feed type A and 2y is the cost for feed type B. ## Step 3: Establish the Constraints ### The cattle needs at least 10 protein units and 8 fat units per day. Therefore, the constraints based on protein and fat requirements are: - Protein constraint: 5x + 2y \\geq 10 - Fat constraint: 5x + 4y \\geq 8 ## Step 4: Non-negativity Constraints ### Since the number of bags cannot be negative, we have: - x \\geq 0 - y \\geq 0 ## Step 5: State the Linear Programming Problem ### The linear programming problem is to minimize the cost function C = 3x + 2y subject to the constraints: \\[ \\begin{align*} 5x + 2y & \\geq 10 \\\\ 5x + 4y & \\geq 8 \\\\ x & \\geq 0 \\\\ y & \\geq 0 \\end{align*} \\]",

The height is 2y^2 inches, so the diameter can be found by subtracting the height from 50: \\[ \\text{Diameter} = 50 - 2y^2 \\] ## Step2: Calculate the Radius ### The radius is half of the diameter. Therefore, the radius r is: \\[ r = \\frac{50 - 2y^2}{2} = 25 - y^2 \\] ## Step3: Compute the Volume ### The volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \\pi r^2 h. Substituting the values for r and h, we have: \\[ V = \\pi (25 - y^2)^2 (2y^2) \\] ### Expanding (25 - y^2)^2 gives: \\[ (25 - y^2)^2 = 625 - 50y^2 + y^4 \\] ### Thus, the volume becomes: \\[ V = \\pi (625 - 50y^2 + y^4)(2y^2) \\] ### Simplifying further: \\[ V = \\pi (2y^2 \\cdot 625 - 2y^2 \\cdot 50y^2 + 2y^2 \\cdot y^4) \\] \\[ V = \\pi (1250y^2 - 100y^4 + 2y^6) \\]",

            "text": "The value of \\(z\\) in the solution of the given system is \\(\\boxed{33.64864864864865}\\). Explanation ## Step 1: Write down the system of equations. We are given the following system of linear equations: \\[ \\begin{cases} -1x - 3y - 1z = -57 \\\\ 4x - 5y - 4z = 36 \\\\ -5x + 3y - 5z = 3 \\end{cases} \\] ## Step 2: Use the method of elimination to solve for \\(z\\). First, we will eliminate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to isolate \\(z\\). ### Eliminate \\(x\\) from the first and second equations: Multiply the first equation by 4: \\[ -4x - 12y - 4z = -228 \\] Add this to the second equation: \\[ (-4x - 12y - 4z) + (4x - 5y - 4z) = -228 + 36 \\] \\[ -17y - 8z = -192 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)} \\] ### Eliminate \\(x\\) from the first and third equations: Multiply the first equation by 5: \\[ -5x - 15y - 5z = -285 \\] Add this to the third equation: \\[ (-5x - 15y - 5z) + (-5x + 3y - 5z) = -285 + 3 \\] \\[ -12y - 10z = -282 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)} \\] ## Step 3: Solve the system of equations for \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Now we have a new system of equations: \\[ \\begin{cases} -17y - 8z = -192 \\\\ -12y - 10z = -282 \\end{cases} \\] ### Eliminate \\(y\\) from these two equations: Multiply Equation 4 by 12 and Equation 5 by 17: \\[ -204y - 96z = -2304 \\] \\[ -204y - 170z = -4794 \\] Subtract the first new equation from the second: \\[ (-204y - 170z) - (-204y - 96z) = -4794 - (-2304) \\] \\[ -74z = -2490 \\] \\[ z = \\frac{-2490}{-74} = 33.64864864864865 \\] ## Step 4: Substitute \\(z\\) back into one of the equations to find \\(y\\). Substitute \\(z = 33.64864864864865\\) into Equation 4: \\[ -17y - 8(33.64864864864865) = -192 \\] \\[ -17y - 269.1891891891892 = -192 \\] \\[ -17y = -192 + 269.1891891891892 \\] \\[ -17y = 77.1891891891892 \\] \\[ y = \\frac{77.1891891891892}{-17} = -4.54054054054054 \\] ## Step 5: Substitute \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(x\\). Substitute \\(y = -4.54054054054054\\) and \\(z = 33.64864864864865\\) into the first original equation: \\[ -1x - 3(-4.54054054054054) - 1(33.64864864864865) = -57 \\] \\[ -1x + 13.62162162162162 - 33.64864864864865 = -57 \\] \\[ -1x - 20.02702702702703 = -57 \\] \\[ -1x = -57 + 20.02702702702703 \\] \\[ -1x = -36.97297297297297 \\] \\[ x = 36.97297297297297 \\]",

For System 1, we have: 1. x - 4z = -1 2. 3x + 3y = 2 3. 3x + 4z = 5 For System 2, we have: 1. x + y + z = 0 2. 2x - y = 4z = 15 (Note: This seems to be a typo; it should likely be 2x - y - 4z = 15) 3. x - 2y - z = 7 ## Step 2: Write the coefficient matrix and constant vector ### For each system, write the coefficient matrix \\( A \\) and the constant vector \\( \\mathbf{b} \\).

            "text": "### The total cost to have all the dirt hauled away is \\ 270. Explanation ## Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Hole ### The volume of a rectangular hole is calculated using the formula \\( V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{depth} \\). Here, the dimensions are 45 feet long, 27 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. Thus, the volume in cubic feet is \\( 45 \\times 27 \\times 6 = 7290 \\) cubic feet. ## Step 2: Convert Cubic Feet to Cubic Yards ### Since there are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic yards by dividing by 27. Therefore, the volume in cubic yards is \\( \\frac{7290}{27} = 270 \\) cubic yards. ## Step 3: Determine the Number of Truck Loads Required ### Each truck can carry 30 cubic yards of dirt. To find the number of loads required, divide the total volume in cubic yards by the truck's capacity: \\( \\frac{270}{30} = 9 \\) loads. ## Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost ### The cost per load is \\ 30. Multiply the number of loads by the cost per load to find the total cost: \\( 9 \\times 30 = 270 \\).",

            "text": "### (a) Domain of \\( f \\): \\((-∞, +∞)\\) ### (b) Range of \\( f \\): \\([-1, +∞)\\) ### (c) \\( x \\)-intercepts: \\( x = 2, 4 \\) ### (d) Intervals on which \\( f \\) is increasing: \\((3, +∞)\\) ### (e) Relative minimum of \\( f \\): \\((3, -1)\\) ### (f) \\( f(-1) = 8 \\) ### (g) Values of \\( x \\) for which \\( f(x) = 3 \\): \\( x = 1, 5 \\) ### (h) \\( f \\) is neither even nor odd. Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the Domain of \\( f \\) ### The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. From the description, the first segment is defined over \\((-∞, 0]\\) and the second segment is defined over \\([0, +∞)\\). Therefore, the domain of \\( f \\) is \\((-∞, +∞)\\). ## Step 2: Determine the Range of \\( f \\) ### The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (y-values). The constant segment \\( y = 8 \\) covers the value 8. The parabola has a vertex at \\((3, -1)\\) and opens upwards, covering all values from \\(-1\\) to \\(+∞\\). Thus, the range of \\( f \\) is \\([-1, +∞)\\). ## Step 3: Find the \\( x \\)-intercepts ### The \\( x \\)-intercepts are the points where the function crosses the x-axis (\\( y = 0 \\)). For the parabola, it passes through points \\((2, 0)\\) and \\((4, 0)\\), so these are the \\( x \\)-intercepts. ## Step 4: Determine Intervals on Which \\( f \\) is Increasing ### A function is increasing on intervals where its derivative is positive. The constant segment \\( y = 8 \\) is neither increasing nor decreasing. The parabola is increasing on the interval \\((3, +∞)\\) because it opens upwards and the vertex is at \\((3, -1)\\). ## Step 5: Find the Relative Minimum of \\( f \\) ### The relative minimum occurs at the lowest point of the parabola, which is the vertex \\((3, -1)\\). ## Step 6: Evaluate \\( f(-1) \\) ### Since \\(-1\\) falls within the domain of the constant segment \\( y = 8 \\), \\( f(-1) = 8 \\). ## Step 7: Solve for \\( x \\) when \\( f(x) = 3 \\) ### For the constant segment, \\( y = 8 \\), there are no solutions. For the parabola, we solve the equation \\( (x-3)^2 - 1 = 3 \\): \\[ (x-3)^2 - 1 = 3 \\\\ (x-3)^2 = 4 \\\\ x-3 = \\pm 2 \\\\ x = 5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 1 \\] Thus, \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = 5 \\). ## Step 8: Determine if \\( f \\) is Even, Odd, or Neither ### A function is even if \\( f(x) = f(-x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain, and odd if \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\). Here, \\( f(x) \\) does not satisfy either condition due to the different definitions on \\((-∞, 0]\\) and \\([0, +∞)\\). Therefore, \\( f \\) is neither even nor odd.",

The total percentage of students in \\( M \\cup E \\) (either math or English or both) is: \\[ |M \\cup E| = |M - E| + |M \\cap E| + |E - M| = 11\\% + 39\\% + 24\\% = 74\\%. \\] 5. The percentage of students in \\( (M \\cup E)^c \\) (neither math nor English) is: \\[ |(M \\cup E)^c| = 100\\% - |M \\cup E| = 100\\% - 74\\% = 26\\%. \\] Thus, the Venn diagram is constructed with the following regions: - \\( M - E = 11\\% \\), - \\( M \\cap E = 39\\% \\), - \\( E - M = 24\\% \\), - \\( (M \\cup E)^c = 26\\% \\). --- ## Step 3: Calculate the probability that a freshman is taking an English course but not a math course ### The probability of a student being in \\( E - M \\) (English but not math) is: \\[ P(E - M) = |E - M| = 24\\%. \\] --- ## Step 4: Calculate the probability that a freshman is not enrolled in either course ### The probability of a student being in \\( (M \\cup E)^c \\) (neither math nor English) is: \\[ P((M \\cup E)^c) = |(M \\cup E)^c| = 26\\%. \\] ---",

In this case, the slope of the given line \\(y = 4x - 1\\) is \\(4\\). Since parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of the line we are looking for is also \\(4\\). ## Step 2: Use the point-slope form to find the equation: Point-Slope Form We know the slope (\\(m = 4\\)) and a point \\((x_1, y_1) = (4, 3)\\) on the line. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\) Substituting the values, we get: \\(y - 3 = 4(x - 4)\\) ## Step 3: Simplify to slope-intercept form: Simplify to Slope-Intercept Now, we simplify the equation to the slope-intercept form (\\(y = mx + b\\)): \\(y - 3 = 4x - 16\\) \\(y = 4x - 16 + 3\\) \\(y = 4x - 13\\)",

            "text": "Homologous chromosomes to separate. Explanation Non-disjunction is an error that can occur during meiosis, where chromosomes don't segregate properly. Specifically during meiosis I, mom and dad's chromosomes (homologous pairs) segregate so each offspring cell will have one complete chromosome set. If nondisjunction happens during this stage, the resultant cells will receive improper chromosome count. This irregular distribution can have severe consequences and can lead to genetic disorders. If there is nondisjunction in meiosis I, the failure lies in the inability of the homologous chromosomes to sufficiently separate and go to separate cells.",

So, one point is \\((0, 4)\\). - When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = -3(2) + 4 = -6 + 4 = -2 \\). So, another point is \\((2, -2)\\). - Plot these points and draw a dashed line through them because the inequality is strict (\\(>\\)). ### Inequality 2: \\( y = 2x - 5 \\) - This is a straight line with a slope of \\(2\\) and a y-intercept of \\(-5\\). - To graph this line, find two points: - When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = -5 \\). So, one point is \\((0, -5)\\). - When \\( x = 2 \\), \\( y = 2(2) - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1 \\). So, another point is \\((2, -1)\\). - Plot these points and draw a solid line through them because the inequality is inclusive (\\(\\leq\\)). ## Step 3: Determine the Solution Region ### The solution region is where the shaded areas for both inequalities overlap. - For \\( y > -3x + 4 \\), shade above the dashed line. - For \\( y \\leq 2x - 5 \\), shade below the solid line. ## Step 4: Identify the Overlapping Region ### The overlapping region is the area that satisfies both inequalities. It lies above the line \\( y = -3x + 4 \\) and below or on the line \\( y = 2x - 5 \\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Known Segments ### From the problem description, we have several line segments with known lengths: - Vertical segments: 3 \\text{ in}, 3 \\text{ in}, 2 \\text{ in}, 4 \\text{ in}, and 4 \\text{ in}. - Horizontal segments: 2 \\text{ in}, 2 \\text{ in}, and 10 \\text{ in}. ## Step 2: Calculate the Total Length of Known Segments ### Add up the lengths of all the known segments: - Total vertical length: 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 16 \\text{ in} - Total horizontal length: 2 + 2 + 10 = 14 \\text{ in} ## Step 3: Determine the Missing Segment Lengths ### Since the shape is a closed figure (dodecagon), the sum of the lengths of the unknown segments must equal the difference needed to complete the perimeter. The total number of sides is 12, so there are 4 unknown segments. ### We know that the total perimeter is the sum of all side lengths. Let \\( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\) be the lengths of the unknown segments. The equation for the perimeter \\( P \\) is: \\[ P = 16 + 14 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 \\] ## Step 4: Solve for the Perimeter ### Since the shape is irregular but closed, the total perimeter can be calculated by summing the known segment lengths and assuming the missing segments balance out to form a closed loop. Given the options, calculate the possible perimeter: - If the unknown segments are balanced such that they close the shape without adding extra length, then the perimeter is simply the sum of the known segments. ### Therefore, the perimeter is: \\[ P = 16 + 14 = 30 \\text{ in} \\]",

In a linear relationship, the rate of change between any two quantities is the same, or constant. This is called the slope. Explanation The problem involves understanding the definitions and properties of linear equations and their rate of change. A linear equation is characterized by its graph being a straight line and having a constant rate of change, which is the slope of the line. The solution to a linear equation consists of pairs of values that satisfy the equation. The rate of change in a linear equation is constant and is referred to as the slope.",

This suggests a vertical asymptote at x = -4. - **Second Segment**: Defined over (-4, 1), it increases and then decreases, with y \\to -\\infty as x \\to -4 and x \\to 1. This indicates vertical asymptotes at both x = -4 and x = 1. - **Third Segment**: Defined over (1, +\\infty), it is a monotonically decreasing curve approaching y = 0 as x \\to +\\infty and y \\to +\\infty as x \\to 1. This confirms a vertical asymptote at x = 1. ## Step 2: Identify Vertical Asymptotes ### The graph has vertical asymptotes at x = -4 and x = 1. A rational function with these asymptotes would have factors in the denominator corresponding to (x+4) and (x-1). ## Step 3: Evaluate Given Options ### Let's evaluate each option based on the identified asymptotes: - **Option A**: \\( F(x) = \\frac{4}{x} \\) has a vertical asymptote only at x = 0, which does not match the graph. - **Option B**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(x-4)} \\) has vertical asymptotes at x = 0 and x = 4, which do not match the graph. - **Option C**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(x+4)} \\) has vertical asymptotes at x = 0 and x = -4, which partially matches the graph but misses the asymptote at x = 1. - **Option D**: \\( F(x) = \\frac{x}{x+4} \\) has a vertical asymptote at x = -4, but not at x = 1. ## Step 4: Determine the Correct Function ### None of the options perfectly match the graph's behavior. However, considering the closest match: - **Option C**: \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(x+4)} \\) has an asymptote at x = -4, which aligns with one of the graph's asymptotes. It also behaves similarly to the first segment for x < -4.",

The general form of a quadratic equation is \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Here, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = 14 \\). ## Step 3: Rewrite the equation ### Rewrite the equation by grouping the \\( x \\)-terms: \\( y = x^2 + 4x + 14 \\). ## Step 4: Complete the square ### To complete the square, take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is 4, divide it by 2 to get 2, and then square it to get 4. Add and subtract this square inside the equation: \\( y = x^2 + 4x + 4 - 4 + 14 \\). ## Step 5: Simplify the equation ### Simplify the equation by combining the constants: \\( y = (x^2 + 4x + 4) + 10 \\). ## Step 6: Write in vertex form ### The expression \\( x^2 + 4x + 4 \\) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be written as \\( (x + 2)^2 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\( y = (x + 2)^2 + 10 \\). ## Step 7: Identify the vertex form ### The equation \\( y = (x + 2)^2 + 10 \\) is now in vertex form, where the vertex is at \\( (-2, 10) \\).",

Explanation ## Part (a): Finding the zero of \\( f(x) \\) ### Step 1: Set the function equal to zero To find the zero of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{7x + 7}{2x - 4} \\), we set \\( f(x) = 0 \\): \\[ \\frac{7x + 7}{2x - 4} = 0 \\] ### Step 2: Solve for \\( x \\) For a fraction to be zero, the numerator must be zero (since the denominator cannot be zero): \\[ 7x + 7 = 0 \\] Solving for \\( x \\): \\[ 7x = -7 \\implies x = -1 \\] ### Step 3: Verify the solution We need to ensure that \\( x = -1 \\) does not make the denominator zero: \\[ 2(-1) - 4 = -2 - 4 = -6 \\neq 0 \\] Since the denominator is not zero, \\( x = -1 \\) is a valid solution. ## Part (b): Finding the asymptotes ### Step 1: Vertical asymptote The vertical asymptote occurs where the denominator is zero: \\[ 2x - 4 = 0 \\implies x = 2 \\] ### Step 2: Horizontal asymptote To find the horizontal asymptote, we consider the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches infinity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{7x + 7}{2x - 4} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{7 + \\frac{7}{x}}{2 - \\frac{4}{x}} = \\frac{7}{2} \\] Thus, the horizontal asymptote is \\( y = \\frac{7}{2} \\). ## Part (c): Finding the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) ### Step 1: Set \\( y = f(x) \\) \\[ y = \\frac{7x + 7}{2x - 4} \\] ### Step 2: Solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\) Multiply both sides by \\( 2x - 4 \\): \\[ y(2x - 4) = 7x + 7 \\] Distribute \\( y \\): \\[ 2xy - 4y = 7x + 7 \\] Rearrange to isolate \\( x \\): \\[ 2xy - 7x = 4y + 7 \\] Factor out \\( x \\): \\[ x(2y - 7) = 4y + 7 \\] Solve for \\( x \\): \\[ x = \\frac{4y + 7}{2y - 7} \\] ### Step 3: Replace \\( y \\) with \\( x \\) to get \\( f^{-1}(x) \\) \\[ f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{4x + 7}{2x - 7} \\]",

This can be expressed as: \\[ \\text{Total charge from the first restaurant} = 20 + 10x \\] ### Similarly, the total charge for the second restaurant is the sum of its delivery fee and the cost per pizza multiplied by the number of pizzas. This can be expressed as: \\[ \\text{Total charge from the second restaurant} = 50 + 9x \\] ## Step 2: Set the total charges equal to find the number of pizzas where the charges are the same. ### To find the number of pizzas \\( x \\) where the total charges are the same, we set the two expressions equal to each other: \\[ 20 + 10x = 50 + 9x \\]",

No significant difference between observed and expected frequencies. ### 4. df = n - 1 ### 5. At least one category is needed to assess variability. ### 6.

Do not reject the null hypothesis; no significant difference exists. ### 9. df = 3 ### 10. Not statistically significant (chi-square value = 1, critical value = 3.841). Explanation ## Step1: Purpose of the Chi-Squared Test ### The Chi-Squared test is used in science to determine if there is a significant difference between the expected and observed frequencies in categorical data. ## Step2: Components of the Chi-Squared Formula ### In the formula X^{2}=\\sum \\frac{(o-e)^{2}}{e}, o represents the observed frequency, e represents the expected frequency, and \\sum denotes the summation over all categories. ## Step3: Null Hypothesis Statement ### The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies; any differences are due to random chance. ## Step4: Determining Degrees of Freedom ### Degrees of freedom (df) are determined by the formula df = n - 1, where n is the number of categories or outcomes. ## Step5: No Zero Degrees of Freedom ### There are no degrees of freedom equal to zero because at least one category is needed to perform the test, and with zero degrees of freedom, no variability can be assessed. ## Step6: Alpha Value .05 Column ### Using the alpha value .05 column means you are looking up the critical value for a significance level of 0.05, which indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference. ## Step7: Chi-Square Value Higher than Critical Value ### If the chi-square value is higher than the critical value, it means the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant difference between observed and expected frequencies. ## Step8: Chi-Square Value Lower than Critical Value ### If the chi-square value is lower than the critical value, it means the null hypothesis is not rejected, indicating no significant difference between observed and expected frequencies. ## Step9: Degrees of Freedom for 4 Outcomes ### For 4 outcomes, the degrees of freedom would be df = 4 - 1 = 3. ## Step10: Calculating Chi-Square Test for Coin Flip ### Observed frequencies: Heads = 55, Tails = 45. Expected frequencies: Heads = 50, Tails = 50 (since a fair coin has an equal probability of heads and tails). \\[ X^{2} = \\sum \\frac{(o-e)^{2}}{e} = \\frac{(55-50)^{2}}{50} + \\frac{(45-50)^{2}}{50} = \\frac{25}{50} + \\frac{25}{50} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \\] ### With 1 degree of freedom (df = 2 - 1), we compare the calculated chi-square value (1) to the critical value from the chi-square distribution table at alpha = 0.05. The critical value for df = 1 at alpha = 0.05 is approximately 3.841. ### Since 1 < 3.841, we do not reject the null hypothesis, indicating the results are not statistically significant.",

            "text": "### The height of domino number 9 is approximately 7.29 inches. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the initial height and the growth rate ### The initial height of the smallest domino, numbered 0, is 3.00 inches. Each subsequent domino is 11% taller than the previous one. This means the height of each domino is multiplied by 1.11 (which is 1 + 0.11) to get the height of the next domino. ## Step 2: Use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence ### The height of the nth domino can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: \\( h_n = h_0 \\times r^n \\), where \\( h_0 \\) is the initial height, \\( r \\) is the growth rate, and \\( n \\) is the term number. ## Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula ### For domino number 9, we substitute \\( h_0 = 3.00 \\) inches, \\( r = 1.11 \\), and \\( n = 9 \\) into the formula: \\( h_9 = 3.00 \\times (1.11)^9 \\). ## Step 4: Calculate the height of domino number 9 ### Compute \\( (1.11)^9 \\) and then multiply by 3.00 to find the height of domino number 9.",

Since the ones digit of 35 is 5, we need to find the probability of drawing another marble ending in 5 from the remaining 79 marbles. There are 8 marbles in total that end in 5 (05, 15, 25, ..., 75), and one of them has already been drawn. Therefore, there are 7 marbles left that end in 5 out of the remaining 79 marbles. ## Problem 15: ### To find the equation of the line passing through the origin (0,0) and the point (3,4), we use the slope-intercept form of a line, \\(y = mx + b\\). The slope \\(m\\) is calculated as the change in \\(y\\) divided by the change in \\(x\\), which is \\(\\frac{4-0}{3-0} = \\frac{4}{3}\\). Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept \\(b\\) is 0. Therefore, the equation of the line is \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}x\\).",

No, \\((0,4)\\) will not be included in the solution set. ### 8. b. \\((0,-2)\\) Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the Inequality ### The given line equation is \\(2x - 5y = 10\\). Ethan needs to graph the inequality \\(2x - 5y > 10\\). This inequality represents the region above the line because it includes points where the expression \\(2x - 5y\\) is greater than 10. ## Step 2: Determining the Shaded Region ### To determine which region to shade, we need to test a point not on the line. A common choice is the origin \\((0,0)\\). Substitute \\((0,0)\\) into the inequality: \\[ 2(0) - 5(0) > 10 \\] \\[ 0 > 10 \\] ### This statement is false, so the region containing the origin is not part of the solution set. Therefore, Ethan should shade the region opposite to the origin relative to the line, which is region \\(A\\). ## Step 3: Checking if Point \\((0,4)\\) is Included ### Substitute \\((0,4)\\) into the inequality: \\[ 2(0) - 5(4) > 10 \\] \\[ -20 > 10 \\] ### This statement is false, so the point \\((0,4)\\) is not included in the solution set. ## Step 4: Identifying Points Not Included in the Solution Set ### We need to check each point against the inequality \\(2x - 5y > 10\\): - **Point (3,-3):** \\[ 2(3) - 5(-3) = 6 + 15 = 21 \\] \\[ 21 > 10 \\] (True) - **Point (0,-2):** \\[ 2(0) - 5(-2) = 0 + 10 = 10 \\] \\[ 10 > 10 \\] (False) - **Point (-2,-4):** \\[ 2(-2) - 5(-4) = -4 + 20 = 16 \\] \\[ 16 > 10 \\] (True) - **Point (-6,-7):** \\[ 2(-6) - 5(-7) = -12 + 35 = 23 \\] \\[ 23 > 10 \\] (True) ### The point \\((0,-2)\\) does not satisfy the inequality and thus will not be included in the solution set.",

The cost increases as the number of miles driven increases. This suggests a linear relationship between miles and cost. ## Step 2: Determine the rate of increase in cost per mile ### To find the rate of increase (slope), calculate the difference in cost divided by the difference in miles: \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Cost}}{\\text{Change in Miles}} = \\frac{59.99 - 41.99}{250 - 100} \\] \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{18.00}{150} = 0.12 \\, (\\ \\text{per mile}) \\] ## Step 3: Derive the cost equation ### Using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, \\( C = mM + b \\), where \\( C \\) is the cost, \\( M \\) is the miles, \\( m \\) is the slope (rate), and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. Substituting one known point, \\( (100, 41.99) \\), into the equation: \\[ 41.99 = 0.12(100) + b \\] \\[ 41.99 = 12 + b \\] \\[ b = 29.99 \\] Thus, the cost equation is: \\[ C = 0.12M + 29.99 \\] ## Step 4: Calculate the missing costs ### Use the equation \\( C = 0.12M + 29.99 \\) to compute the costs for the missing values: - For \\( M = 10 \\): \\[ C = 0.12(10) + 29.99 = 1.20 + 29.99 = 31.19 \\] - For \\( M = 50 \\): \\[ C = 0.12(50) + 29.99 = 6.00 + 29.99 = 35.99 \\] - For \\( M = 150 \\): \\[ C = 0.12(150) + 29.99 = 18.00 + 29.99 = 47.99 \\] - For \\( M = 200 \\): \\[ C = 0.12(200) + 29.99 = 24.00 + 29.99 = 53.99 \\] - For \\( M = 300 \\): \\[ C = 0.12(300) + 29.99 = 36.00 + 29.99 = 65.99 \\] ## Step 5: Complete the table ### Fill in the calculated costs into the blank fields of the table.",

Set x^2 - 5x - 6 = 0 and solve for x. The solutions are x = 6 and x = -1. Thus, the domain is all real numbers except x = 6 and x = -1. ## Step 2: Find the Y-intercept ### To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 in the function f(x). This gives f(0) = \\frac{0^2 - 2 \\cdot 0 - 3}{0^2 - 5 \\cdot 0 - 6} = \\frac{-3}{-6} = \\frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the y-intercept is at (0, \\frac{1}{2}). ## Step 3: Find the X-intercepts ### The x-intercepts occur where the numerator is zero. Set x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 and solve for x. The solutions are x = 3 and x = -1. Thus, the x-intercepts are at (3, 0) and (-1, 0). ## Step 4: Identify Holes ### A hole occurs where both the numerator and denominator are zero. Since x = -1 makes both the numerator and denominator zero, there is a hole at x = -1. ## Step 5: Locate Vertical Asymptotes ### Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but not the numerator. From Step 1, x = 6 is a vertical asymptote since it does not make the numerator zero. ## Step 6: Determine Horizontal Asymptote ### For horizontal asymptotes, compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Both have degree 2, so the horizontal asymptote is y = \\frac{1}{1} = 1. ## Step 7: Check for Oblique Asymptote ### An oblique asymptote exists if the degree of the numerator is exactly one more than the degree of the denominator. Here, they are equal, so there is no oblique asymptote.",

System 2 has the same first equation and needs a new second equation. ## Step 2: Determine the equivalent transformation ### To maintain equivalence, the new equation in System 2 must be a linear combination of the equations in System 1. ## Step 3: Evaluate each option ### Check each option to see if it represents a linear combination of the given equations that maintains the same solution set. ### Option (ब): \\((8)(2)x - (4)(2)y = (12)(3) \\) simplifies to \\(16x - 8y = 36\\), which is not a valid transformation of the second equation. ### Option (1): \\((8x - 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 12 + 3 \\) simplifies to \\(6x - 6y = 15\\), which is not equivalent. ### Option (C): \\(\\frac{1}{4}(8x - 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 12 - 3 \\) simplifies to \\(2x - y - 2x - 2y = 9\\), which simplifies to \\(-3y = 9\\), not equivalent. ### Option (1): \\((2x + 2y) - \\frac{1}{4}(8x - 4y) = 3 - \\frac{1}{4}(12) \\) simplifies to \\(2x + 2y - 2x + y = 3 - 3\\), which simplifies to \\(3y = 0\\), not equivalent. ## Step 4: Choose the correct transformation ### None of the options provided are equivalent transformations of the second equation in System 1.",

            "text": "\\(0, -\\frac{27}{4}\\) Explanation ## Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor: We are given the equation \\(12q^2 + 81q = 0\\). The greatest common factor of \\(12q^2\\) and \\(81q\\) is \\(3q\\). Factoring this out gives us: \\(3q(4q + 27) = 0\\) ## Step 2: Apply the Zero Product Property: The Zero Product Property states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for \\(q\\). \\(3q = 0\\) or \\(4q + 27 = 0\\) ## Step 3: Solve for q: For the first equation, \\(3q = 0\\), we divide both sides by 3 to get \\(q = 0\\). For the second equation, \\(4q + 27 = 0\\), we subtract 27 from both sides to get \\(4q = -27\\). Then, we divide both sides by 4 to get \\(q = -\\frac{27}{4}\\).",

            "text": "### a. The range is [-4, \\infty). ### b. The vertex is (-6, -4). ### c. The axis of symmetry is x = -6. ### d. The y-intercept is (0, 32). ### e. The x-intercepts are (-4, 0), (-8, 0). Explanation ## Step1: Determine the Range ### The function f(x) = (x+6)^2 - 4 is a quadratic function in vertex form, where the vertex is at its minimum point. Since the coefficient of (x+6)^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The minimum value of f(x) occurs at the vertex, which is -4. Therefore, the range of the function is [-4, \\infty). ## Step2: Find the Vertex ### The vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. For f(x) = (x+6)^2 - 4, the vertex is (-6, -4). ## Step3: Determine the Axis of Symmetry ### The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function in vertex form f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k is the vertical line x = h. Here, h = -6, so the axis of symmetry is x = -6. ## Step4: Calculate the Y-intercept ### The y-intercept occurs when x = 0. Substitute x = 0 into the function: f(0) = (0+6)^2 - 4 = 36 - 4 = 32. Thus, the y-intercept is (0, 32). ## Step5: Calculate the X-intercepts ### The x-intercepts occur when f(x) = 0. Set the equation to zero and solve for x: \\[ (x+6)^2 - 4 = 0 \\\\ (x+6)^2 = 4 \\\\ x+6 = \\pm 2 \\] Solving these gives x = -4 and x = -8. Therefore, the x-intercepts are (-4, 0) and (-8, 0).",

Dilation with scale factor of 13 Explanation ## Step 1: Analyze each transformation rule and match it with the corresponding type of transformation. ### **1. (x,y) \\rightarrow (x-5,y)** This transformation shifts every point 5 units to the left along the x-axis. This is a **translation**. ### **2. (x,y) \\rightarrow (-x,-y)** This transformation changes the sign of both coordinates, effectively rotating the figure 180 degrees around the origin. This is a **rotation**. ### **3. (x,y) \\rightarrow (y,x)** This transformation swaps the x and y coordinates, which is equivalent to reflecting the figure across the line y = x. This is a **reflection**. ### **4. (x,y) \\rightarrow (13x,13y)** This transformation scales both coordinates by a factor of 13, which is a **dilation**. ## Step 2: Match each transformation with the corresponding option from Column B. ### **1.

            "text": "### (c) I would expect the patient's right foot to be cooler than average since the correlation is positive. ### (d) Those who have warmer left foot generally have warmer right feet as well. Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding Correlation Coefficient ### The correlation coefficient, denoted as r, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A positive r indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. ## Step 2: Interpretation of Given Correlation Coefficient ### Given r = 0.528, which is a positive value, it suggests a moderate positive correlation between the temperatures of the left and right feet. This means that if one foot's temperature is above average, the other is likely to be above average too, and vice versa. ## Step 3: Answering Part (c) ### If a patient's left foot is cooler than average, we would expect the patient's right foot to also be cooler than average since there is a positive correlation (r = 0.528) between the temperatures of the left and right feet. ## Step 4: Answering Part (d) ### The best interpretation of the correlation coefficient is: \"Those who have warmer left foot generally have warmer right feet as well.\" This aligns with the positive correlation observed.",

Rearrange to get y = 2x - 10. ## Step2: Identify Slope and Y-Intercept ### The equation y = 2x - 10 is in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Here, the slope m = 2 and the y-intercept b = -10. ## Step3: Plot Key Points ### Use the y-intercept (0, -10) and another point derived from the slope. From (0, -10), move up 2 units and right 1 unit to find another point on the line, (1, -8). ## Step4: Draw the Line ### With the points (0, -10) and (1, -8), draw a straight line through these points. The line should have a positive slope and intersect the y-axis at -10.",

The x-intercepts of a quadratic function are the points where the graph of the function crosses the x-axis, which means \\(y = 0\\). ## Step 2: Quadratic Formula and Discriminant ### The x-intercepts of a quadratic function can be found using the quadratic formula: \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). The term under the square root, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is called the discriminant. The discriminant determines the number of real solutions (x-intercepts) of the quadratic equation. ## Step 3: Discriminant Analysis ### - If the discriminant is positive (\\(b^2 - 4ac > 0\\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions, meaning the graph crosses the x-axis at two points. ### - If the discriminant is zero (\\(b^2 - 4ac = 0\\)), the quadratic equation has exactly one real solution, meaning the graph touches the x-axis at one point. ### - If the discriminant is negative (\\(b^2 - 4ac < 0\\)), the quadratic equation has no real solutions, meaning the graph does not cross the x-axis at all. ## Step 4: Minimum Number of X-Intercepts ### Based on the discriminant analysis, the minimum number of x-intercepts a quadratic function can have is zero, which occurs when the discriminant is negative.",

The \\( y \\)-intercept occurs when \\( x = 0 \\). \\[ f(0) = 6 - 3(0) = 6 \\] Thus, \\[ \\frac{1}{3} f(0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 6 = 2 \\] The \\( y \\)-intercept of \\( \\frac{1}{3} f(x) \\) is 2. ## Step 2: Determine the \\( y \\)-intercept of \\( f(x) - 4 \\) ### Now, let's find the \\( y \\)-intercept of \\( f(x) - 4 \\).

Therefore, the domain of the function is (0, \\infty). ## Step2: Identify the Vertical Asymptote ### A vertical asymptote occurs where the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as x approaches a certain value. For logarithmic functions like \\log_{5}x, as x approaches 0^+, the logarithm approaches negative infinity. Thus, there is a vertical asymptote at x = 0.",

First, we convert these fractions to decimals for easier comparison: - \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 - \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.714 We need a number between 0.6 and 0.714. Let's convert each option to decimals: - A. \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 - B. \\frac{3}{7} \\approx 0.429 - C. \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.889 - D. \\frac{19}{35} \\approx 0.543 - E. \\frac{47}{70} \\approx 0.671 The number \\frac{47}{70} \\approx 0.671 lies between 0.6 and 0.714. Therefore, the correct answer is **E**. ## Problem 2: ### We are given the system of equations: 1. x + 2y = 5 2. 2x + y = 16 We need to find the value of x + y. First, we solve for x and y. Multiply the first equation by 2: - 2x + 4y = 10 Subtract the second equation from this result: - (2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 10 - 16 - 3y = -6 - y = -2 Substitute y = -2 into the first equation: - x + 2(-2) = 5 - x - 4 = 5 - x = 9 Now, calculate x + y: - x + y = 9 + (-2) = 7 Therefore, the correct answer is **D**. ## Problem 3: ### Jeanette drives 5 miles every 7 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to drive 90 miles, we set up the proportion: - \\frac{5 \\text{ miles}}{7 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{90 \\text{ miles}}{x \\text{ minutes}} Cross-multiply to solve for x: - 5x = 90 \\times 7 - 5x = 630 - x = \\frac{630}{5} = 126 \\text{ minutes} Convert 126 minutes to hours and minutes: - 126 \\text{ minutes} = 2 \\text{ hours} \\, 6 \\text{ minutes} Therefore, the correct answer is **B**. ## Problem 4: ### Juan walks at a rate of 8 kilometers per hour. To find the length of the bridge he crosses in 6 minutes, we first convert 6 minutes to hours: - 6 \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{6}{60} \\text{ hours} = 0.1 \\text{ hours} Calculate the distance: - Distance = Speed × Time - Distance = 8 \\text{ km/h} \\times 0.1 \\text{ h} = 0.8 \\text{ km} Convert kilometers to meters: - 0.8 \\text{ km} = 0.8 \\times 1000 \\text{ m} = 800 \\text{ m} Therefore, the correct answer is **E**.",

            "text": "### f'(t) = \\frac{3^{3t} \\left[3t \\ln(3) - 1\\right]}{t^2} Explanation ## Step1: Apply the Quotient Rule ### The function f(t) = \\frac{3^{3t}}{t} is a quotient. To differentiate it, we use the quotient rule: \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}. Here, u = 3^{3t} and v = t. ## Step2: Differentiate the Numerator ### The derivative of u = 3^{3t} is found using the chain rule. Recall that \\frac{d}{dt}[a^{g(t)}] = a^{g(t)} \\ln(a) g'(t). For 3^{3t}, g(t) = 3t, so g'(t) = 3. Thus, u' = 3^{3t} \\ln(3) \\cdot 3 = 3^{3t} \\cdot 3 \\ln(3). ## Step3: Differentiate the Denominator ### The denominator v = t has a straightforward derivative: v' = 1. ## Step4: Substitute into the Quotient Rule Formula ### Substituting u, u', v, and v' into the quotient rule formula gives: \\[ f'(t) = \\frac{(3^{3t} \\cdot 3 \\ln(3)) \\cdot t - (3^{3t}) \\cdot 1}{t^2}. \\] ## Step5: Simplify the Expression ### Factor out 3^{3t} from the numerator: \\[ f'(t) = \\frac{3^{3t} \\left[3t \\ln(3) - 1\\right]}{t^2}. \\]",

            "text": "### -2\\sqrt{14}i Explanation ## Step1: Identify the Imaginary Component ### Recognize that \\sqrt{-56} involves an imaginary number since it is the square root of a negative number. The imaginary unit i is defined as i = \\sqrt{-1}. Therefore, \\sqrt{-56} can be rewritten using i as \\sqrt{56} \\cdot i. ## Step2: Simplify the Radical ### Simplify \\sqrt{56} by factoring 56 into its prime factors: 56 = 2^3 \\times 7. Thus, \\sqrt{56} = \\sqrt{2^3 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 14} = \\sqrt{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{14} = 2\\sqrt{14}. ## Step3: Combine and Simplify ### Substitute back into the expression: -\\sqrt{-56} = -(\\sqrt{56} \\cdot i) = -(2\\sqrt{14} \\cdot i) = -2\\sqrt{14}i. This is the simplified form of the complex number.",

            "text": "### The integer points to plot for the function f(x) = 2(3^x) are (0, 2), (1, 6), and (2, 18). Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Function ### The function given is f(x) = 2(3^x). This is an exponential function where the base is 3 and it is multiplied by 2. The general form of an exponential function is a \\cdot b^x, where a is a constant multiplier, and b is the base of the exponent. ## Step 2: Identify Key Points ### To graph this function using integer points, we need to calculate f(x) for several integer values of x. Let's choose some integer values for x: x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. ## Step 3: Calculate Function Values ### Calculate f(x) for each chosen integer value of x: - For x = -2: \\[ f(-2) = 2 \\cdot 3^{-2} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} \\] (Not an integer point) - For x = -1: \\[ f(-1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{-1} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\] (Not an integer point) - For x = 0: \\[ f(0) = 2 \\cdot 3^{0} = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\] (Integer point: (0, 2)) - For x = 1: \\[ f(1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{1} = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6 \\] (Integer point: (1, 6)) - For x = 2: \\[ f(2) = 2 \\cdot 3^{2} = 2 \\cdot 9 = 18 \\] (Integer point: (2, 18)) ## Step 4: Plot the Integer Points ### Based on the calculations, the integer points that can be plotted are (0, 2), (1, 6), and (2, 18). These points represent the key points of the function f(x) = 2(3^x) on the Cartesian coordinate system.",

Explanation A radical equation is an equation that contains a variable inside a radical symbol, such as a square root, cube root, or any other root. To solve a radical equation, the first step is to isolate the radical on one side of the equation. Then, to eliminate the radical, you raise both sides of the equation to the power that is the index of the radical. After eliminating the radical, you solve the resulting equation. It's important to check the solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid, as squaring both sides of an equation can introduce extraneous solutions.",

Therefore, the correct answer choices are: - \\((2x + 5)\\) - \\((x + 3)\\) Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the polynomial to be factored. The given polynomial is \\(2x^2 + 11x + 15\\). ## Step 2: Use the AC method to factor the polynomial. The AC method involves multiplying the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) (which is 2) by the constant term (which is 15). This gives us \\(2 \\times 15 = 30\\). ## Step 3: Find two numbers that multiply to 30 and add up to the coefficient of \\(x\\) (which is 11). The two numbers that satisfy this condition are 5 and 6, because \\(5 \\times 6 = 30\\) and \\(5 + 6 = 11\\). ## Step 4: Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers. Rewrite \\(11x\\) as \\(5x + 6x\\). The polynomial becomes: \\[2x^2 + 5x + 6x + 15\\] ## Step 5: Group the terms and factor by grouping. Group the terms as follows: \\[(2x^2 + 5x) + (6x + 15)\\] Factor out the greatest common factor from each group: \\[x(2x + 5) + 3(2x + 5)\\] ## Step 6: Factor out the common binomial factor. The common binomial factor is \\((2x + 5)\\). Factor this out: \\[(2x + 5)(x + 3)\\] ## Step 7: Identify the factors of the polynomial. The factors of the polynomial \\(2x^2 + 11x + 15\\) are \\((2x + 5)\\) and \\((x + 3)\\).",

The product of a binomial and its conjugate is a difference of squares. ## Step2: Multiply by the Conjugate ### Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate 2 + \\sqrt{3} to eliminate the square root in the denominator. This gives \\frac{5(2+\\sqrt{3})}{(2-\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})}. ## Step3: Simplify the Denominator ### Use the difference of squares formula: (a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2. Here, a = 2 and b = \\sqrt{3}, so the denominator becomes 2^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1. ## Step4: Simplify the Numerator ### Distribute the 5 in the numerator: 5(2+\\sqrt{3}) = 10 + 5\\sqrt{3}. ## Step5: Final Expression ### Since the denominator is now 1, the expression simplifies to 10 + 5\\sqrt{3}.",

            "text": "### I. The y-intercept of the graph is 286. ### III. The graph increases as the value of \\( x \\) increases. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the y-intercept ### The y-intercept of the graph is the value of \\( y \\) when \\( x = 0 \\). Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the function \\( y = 286(1.035)^x \\), we get \\( y = 286(1.035)^0 = 286 \\). Therefore, the y-intercept is 286. ## Step 2: Determine the x-intercept ### The x-intercept is the value of \\( x \\) when \\( y = 0 \\). However, since \\( y = 286(1.035)^x \\) and \\( 1.035^x \\) is always positive for all real \\( x \\), \\( y \\) can never be zero. Therefore, there is no x-intercept. ## Step 3: Analyze the behavior of the graph ### As \\( x \\) increases, \\( (1.035)^x \\) increases because the base \\( 1.035 \\) is greater than 1. This means that \\( y \\) increases as \\( x \\) increases. ## Step 4: Identify asymptotes ### The graph does not have an asymptote at \\( x = 0 \\) because the function is defined for all real \\( x \\). The graph does not have an asymptote at \\( y = 286 \\) because the function increases without bound as \\( x \\) increases.",

This process is called peristalsis. ## Step2 Let's examine each option: a. A bowel movement is the act of expelling feces from the body through the rectum and anus. It is not the process of moving food or chyme through the digestive tract. b. Swallowing is the act of moving food from the mouth to the esophagus using the tongue and throat muscles. While it is a part of the digestive process, it is not the continuous wavelike motion that occurs throughout the digestive tract. c. Paralysis refers to the loss of the ability to move. In the context of digestion, it would mean an inability to produce the muscular contractions needed for peristalsis. This is not the term that describes the positive motion of moving food or chyme. d. Peristalsis is the correct answer. It is the term for the wavelike motion that moves food or chyme through the digestive tract.",

Quadratic functions are of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\). The coefficient \\( a \\) determines whether the parabola opens upwards (minimum value) or downwards (maximum value).

Explanation ## Step1: Define Direct Variation ### Direct variation describes a relationship between two variables where one is a constant multiple of the other. Mathematically, if y varies directly with x, then y = kx, where k is the constant of variation. ## Step2: Understand Lines and Slope ### A line in a coordinate plane can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The slope m represents the rate of change of y with respect to x. ## Step3: Connect Rates of Change and Slope ### The rate of change in a linear relationship is constant and is represented by the slope m. It indicates how much y changes for a unit change in x. ## Step4: Relate Direct Variation to Slope ### In direct variation, the equation y = kx is a special case of the linear equation y = mx + b where b = 0. Here, the slope m is equivalent to the constant of variation k, showing that the rate of change (slope) is constant.",

This gives \\( f(0) = -2\\sqrt{0+4} + 2 = -2\\sqrt{4} + 2 = -2 \\cdot 2 + 2 = -4 + 2 = -2 \\). Therefore, the y-intercept is at \\( (0, -2) \\). ## Step 2: Determine the Domain ### The domain of the function is determined by the expression inside the square root, \\( x + 4 \\). For the square root to be defined, \\( x + 4 \\geq 0 \\). Solving this inequality, we get \\( x \\geq -4 \\). Therefore, the domain is \\( x \\geq -4 \\). ## Step 3: Determine the Range ### The range of the function is determined by the output values of \\( f(x) \\). Since \\( \\sqrt{x+4} \\geq 0 \\), the term \\( -2\\sqrt{x+4} \\) is always less than or equal to 0. Adding 2 to this term, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is 2 when \\( x = -4 \\). As \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range is \\( f(x) \\leq 2 \\). # Answer: ### a. Y-intercept: \\( (0, -2) \\) ### b. Domain: \\( x \\geq -4 \\) ### c. Range: \\( f(x) \\leq 2 \\)",

            "text": "### The ticket price should be approximately 39.70, and the number of tickets sold should be approximately 3250 to maximize profit. However, since the options provided are limited, the closest option is 39.7. Explanation ## Step 1: Define Profit ### Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the number of tickets sold multiplied by the ticket price, which is \\(x \\times y\\). The total cost is given by the equation \\(c = 50x + 2000\\). ## Step 2: Formulate the Profit Equation ### Substitute \\(y = -2x^2 + 100x + 2000\\) into the revenue formula to get the revenue equation: \\(R = x(-2x^2 + 100x + 2000)\\). The profit equation is then \\(P = R - c = x(-2x^2 + 100x + 2000) - (50x + 2000)\\). ## Step 3: Simplify the Profit Equation ### Simplify the profit equation to \\(P = -2x^3 + 100x^2 + 1950x - 2000\\). ## Step 4: Find the Critical Points ### To find the maximum profit, take the derivative of the profit equation with respect to \\(x\\) and set it to zero: \\(\\frac{dP}{dx} = -6x^2 + 200x + 1950 = 0\\). ## Step 5: Solve the Quadratic Equation ### Solve the quadratic equation \\(-6x^2 + 200x + 1950 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = -6\\), \\(b = 200\\), and \\(c = 1950\\). ## Step 6: Calculate the Ticket Price ### Calculate the ticket price \\(x\\) using the quadratic formula. The positive root is approximately \\(x = 39.7\\). ## Step 7: Calculate the Number of Tickets Sold ### Substitute \\(x = 39.7\\) into the ticket sales equation \\(y = -2x^2 + 100x + 2000\\) to find the number of tickets sold.",

We need to find the height of the building. ## Step 2: Use the tangent function ### The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the height of the building, and the adjacent side is the distance from the observer to the base of the building. ## Step 3: Set up the equation ### Using the tangent function, we can set up the equation: \\(\\tan(25^\\circ) = \\frac{\\text{height}}{180}\\). ## Step 4: Solve for the height ### Rearrange the equation to solve for the height: \\(\\text{height} = 180 \\times \\tan(25^\\circ)\\). ## Step 5: Calculate the height ### Using a calculator, we find that \\(\\tan(25^\\circ) \\approx 0.4663\\). Therefore, the height is approximately \\(180 \\times 0.4663 = 83.934\\) meters.",

            "text": "C Explanation The question involves determining the correct punctuation to complete a sentence in a way that conforms to Standard English. The sentence describes the appearance of Saturn's rings as viewed through a telescope from Earth, and it introduces a contrast in the latter part of the sentence. This contrast is indicated by the word \"however\". Option A (\"A giant, however. The\") incorrectly uses a comma before \"however\" and starts a new sentence with \"The,\" which disrupts the flow and grammatical structure. Option B (\"B giant; however the\") uses a semicolon before \"however,\" which is a correct way to link two independent clauses. However, it lacks the necessary comma after \"however,\" which is standard in English when \"however\" is used as a transitional word. Option C (\"C giant. However, the\") correctly uses a period to end the first clause and starts a new sentence with \"However,\" followed by a comma. This maintains the grammatical structure and correctly conveys the contrast. Option D (\"D giant, however-the\") uses a comma before \"however\" and a dash after it. This is unconventional and does not conform to the standard use of punctuation in English. Therefore, the correct choice is C, which uses appropriate punctuation to separate the clauses and introduce the contrast.",

            "text": "2 Explanation This question aims to understand the nature of scientific investigation. Scientific investigation is the process of questioning, predicting, observing, interpreting, and concluding based on evidence and reasoning. This process seeks testable explanations and predictions about the natural universe. Consequently, the questions that pertain to scientific investigation are those that can be tested empirically, but personal opinions, intuitions, or conclusions not based on verifiable evidence don’t make into scientific-profiling rich gathering. Out of the given options: 1. \"Is the plutonium dangerous to the health of living organisms?\" - This can be a valid scientific question because it requires conducting scientific experiments and observations to answer. 2. \"Are neighboring communities concerned about the construction?\" is rather based on personal opinions and views than on empirical and objective evidence. A scientist can't provide a valid and reliable answer to this question; it belongs to the social science spectrum than being a scientific query. 3. \"Is it possible to use non-radioactive elements in the reactor?\" - Another scientific question open to experimental conclusions. 4. \"Will the reactor affect the fish in the river water near the reactor?\" - Empirically Researchable question, measuring environmental impacts and the welfare of the associated life. So, answering which question is not a part of a scientific investigation boils down to question 2 among these.",

            "text": "### linear Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Definition of Linear and Nonlinear Functions ### A linear function is one where the graph of the function forms a straight line. This means that there is a constant rate of change between the x-values and y-values, which can be represented by the equation \\( y = mx + b \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( b \\) is the y-intercept. In contrast, a nonlinear function does not form a straight line and has a varying rate of change. ## Step 2: Analyze the Given Points ### The points given are A(-1, 2), B(0, 5), and C(1, 8). To determine if these points represent a linear function, we need to check if the rate of change (slope) between each pair of points is constant. ## Step 3: Calculate the Slope Between Each Pair of Points ### The formula for the slope between two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is: \\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\] ### Calculate the slope between points A and B: \\[ m_{AB} = \\frac{5 - 2}{0 - (-1)} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\] ### Calculate the slope between points B and C: \\[ m_{BC} = \\frac{8 - 5}{1 - 0} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3 \\] ### Since the slopes \\( m_{AB} \\) and \\( m_{BC} \\) are equal, the points lie on a straight line. ## Step 4: Conclusion ### Since the slopes between all consecutive points are equal, the ordered pairs represent a linear function.",

            "text": "9. x = 1, y = -2 12. x = 5, y = -5 10. Both equations are equivalent, neither can be subtracted from the other for solving. For the third equation, you cannot solve along with these two. 13. After eliminating variable x, an equation is formed between the first and second one that is unsolvable. 15. After eliminating variable x, an equation is formed with graphs of straight lines that are parallel where it makes no sense to find y, as they would never intersect to provide a joint solution, they're two parallel lines with distinctive independent solutions. 11. x = -1, y = 2 14. After using combining both equations by cleaning up, they turn out to be the same line, effectively reducing it down to one line equation instead of a system of equation thus the system has infinitely many solutions. 16. Similar to 14, implies that the lines representing the equations are indeed the same line. Explanation Our goal here is to \"Solve the linear system using elimination\". That essentially means finding the values of x and y that satisfy the equations set before us in every example. So: 9. For the system provided - '4x - 3y = 8' and '5x - 2y = -11', We'll multiply the first equation by an integer which heaps to effectively cancel either of the variables from the system when subtracted. For example, we multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 and subtract. 12. For the system - '7x + 3y = -12' and '2x + 5y = 38'. Here we'll multiply the first equation by 5, and the second one by 3 to ensure that when subtracted, the equations x gets eliminated. 10. For the system system provided - '-2x - 5y = 9', '2x - 5y = 9', and '3x + 11y = 4' 13. For the system presented - '9x - 8y = 4' and '9x + 2y = 39' 15. For the equations '9x + 2y=39', '6x + 13y=-9' and '2x - 3y = -4' 11. For the equations '7x - 6y = -1' and '5x - 4y = 1' 14. For the following system of equations: '-7x + 10y = 11' and '-8x + 15y = 34'. Essentially, we'll try to eliminate one variable in each system above using the elimination method so we could solve for the other variable which could then be used to find the other variable.",

            "text": "### The equation of the line in the form \\(Ax + By = C\\) is \\(3x - y = 5\\). Explanation ## Step 1: Calculate the Slope ### The slope \\( m \\) of a line passing through two points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is calculated using the formula \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). For the points \\((3,4)\\) and \\((2,1)\\), the slope is \\( m = \\frac{1 - 4}{2 - 3} = \\frac{-3}{-1} = 3 \\). ## Step 2: Use Point-Slope Form ### With the slope \\( m = 3 \\) and one of the points, say \\((3,4)\\), use the point-slope form of the equation \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\). Substituting the values gives \\( y - 4 = 3(x - 3) \\). ## Step 3: Convert to Standard Form ### Expand and rearrange the equation from Step 2 to get it into the standard form \\( Ax + By = C \\). Expanding gives \\( y - 4 = 3x - 9 \\). Rearranging terms results in \\( 3x - y = 5 \\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Inequality ### The inequality given is x < 8. This means we are interested in all values of x that are less than 8. On a number line, this will be represented by a ray starting from 8 and extending to the left. ## Step 2: Determine the Endpoint Type ### Since the inequality is strictly less than (i.e., x < 8), the endpoint at 8 should be open. An open endpoint indicates that the value at that point is not included in the solution set. ## Step 3: Plot the Ray on the Number Line ### Begin by identifying the position of 8 on the number line. Since the intervals are marked every 2 units, 8 will be located four intervals to the right of 0. Place an open circle at 8 to indicate that it is not included in the solution set. Then, draw a ray extending to the left from this open circle, covering all numbers less than 8. ## Step 4: Verify the Graph ### Ensure that the ray correctly represents all numbers less than 8. The open circle at 8 confirms that 8 itself is not part of the solution, while the arrow pointing left shows that all smaller numbers are included.",

Both equations are now in the form \\(10x + 3y = c\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant. ## Step 2: Identify Parallel Lines ### Since both equations have the same coefficients for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) but different constants, they represent parallel lines. Parallel lines never intersect, so the system of equations has no solution. ## Step 3: Conclusion ### The system of equations has no solution because the lines are parallel and do not intersect.",

The graph crosses the \\( x \\)-axis at the zero(s) \\( 3 \\). Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the End Behavior ### The polynomial function \\( f(x) = x^{2}(x-3)^{3}(x+4) \\) has a degree of \\( 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 \\), which is even. The leading term is \\( x^6 \\), and its coefficient is positive. According to the Leading Coefficient Test, if the degree is even and the leading coefficient is positive, the graph rises to the left and to the right. ## Step 2: Find the \\( x \\)-Intercepts ### To find the \\( x \\)-intercepts, set \\( f(x) = 0 \\). The factors are \\( x^2 \\), \\( (x-3)^3 \\), and \\( (x+4) \\). Thus, the \\( x \\)-intercepts are at \\( x = 0 \\), \\( x = 3 \\), and \\( x = -4 \\). ## Step 3: Determine Where the Graph Crosses the \\( x \\)-Axis ### The graph crosses the \\( x \\)-axis at zeros with odd multiplicity. The zero \\( x = 3 \\) has an odd multiplicity of 3, so the graph crosses the \\( x \\)-axis at \\( x = 3 \\).",

The dimensions of the rectangle are given as \\((3x - 23)\\) feet and \\((2x + 3)\\) feet. ## Step 2: Write the formula for the area of a rectangle. The area \\(A\\) of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width: \\[ A = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\] ## Step 3: Substitute the given dimensions into the area formula.

            "text": "### The solution to the inequality is x \\geqslant -5. Explanation ## Step 1: Simplify the Inequality ### Start by expanding and simplifying both sides of the inequality 4(x+3) \\geqslant -(3-x). - Expand the left side: 4(x+3) = 4x + 12. - Expand the right side: -(3-x) = -3 + x. The inequality becomes: \\[ 4x + 12 \\geqslant -3 + x \\] ## Step 2: Isolate the Variable ### Move all terms involving x to one side and constant terms to the other side. - Subtract x from both sides: \\[ 4x + 12 - x \\geqslant -3 + x - x \\] \\[ 3x + 12 \\geqslant -3 \\] - Subtract 12 from both sides: \\[ 3x + 12 - 12 \\geqslant -3 - 12 \\] \\[ 3x \\geqslant -15 \\] ## Step 3: Solve for x ### Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. \\[ \\frac{3x}{3} \\geqslant \\frac{-15}{3} \\] \\[ x \\geqslant -5 \\] ## Step 4: Graph the Solution on the Number Line ### The solution x \\geqslant -5 means that x includes all numbers greater than or equal to -5.

We need to find the missing numbers. To do this, we first identify the pattern in the sequence. ## Step 2: Calculate the common difference ### The difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is constant. We calculate this common difference by subtracting the second known term from the first known term: -79 - (-71) = -8. This indicates that each term decreases by 8. ## Step 3: Determine the missing terms ### Using the common difference, we can find the missing terms. The term before -71 is -71 + 8 = -63. The term before -63 is -63 + 8 = -55. Therefore, the missing terms are -55 and -63.",

This can be seen as a quadratic in terms of \\sqrt{x} by substituting y = \\sqrt{x}, which gives y^2 - 9y + 8 = 0. ## Step2: Solve the Quadratic Equation ### Substitute y = \\sqrt{x} into the equation to get y^2 - 9y + 8 = 0. Use the quadratic formula y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} with a = 1, b = -9, and c = 8 to find the roots of the equation. ### Calculate the discriminant: b^2 - 4ac = (-9)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = 81 - 32 = 49. ### Find the roots: y = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{9 \\pm 7}{2}. ### The solutions for y are y = 8 and y = 1. ## Step3: Back-Substitute to Find x ### Since y = \\sqrt{x}, solve for x: ### For y = 8, \\sqrt{x} = 8 \\Rightarrow x = 64. ### For y = 1, \\sqrt{x} = 1 \\Rightarrow x = 1. ## Step4: Verify Solutions ### Substitute x = 64 and x = 1 back into the original equation to verify they satisfy it.

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the given polynomials ### The given polynomials are -5m^{4}+6m^{3}+8m^{2} and 11m^{4}-10m^{2}+5m. ## Step 2: Determine the operation to be performed ### The operation to be performed is subtraction, which involves subtracting the second polynomial from the first. ## Step 3: Apply the subtraction operation ### Subtract the second polynomial from the first: (-5m^{4}+6m^{3}+8m^{2}) - (11m^{4}-10m^{2}+5m). ## Step 4: Distribute the negative sign ### Distribute the negative sign to each term in the second polynomial: -5m^{4}+6m^{3}+8m^{2} - 11m^{4} + 10m^{2} - 5m. ## Step 5: Combine like terms ### Combine like terms: (-5m^{4} - 11m^{4}) + 6m^{3} + (8m^{2} + 10m^{2}) - 5m. ## Step 6: Simplify the expression ### Simplify the expression: -16m^{4} + 6m^{3} + 18m^{2} - 5m. ## Step 7: Compare the results ### Compare the simplified expression with the results provided by Brad and the other student. Brad's result is -16m^{4}+6m^{3}-2m^{2}+5m, which is incorrect. The other student's result is -16m^{4}-6m^{3}+18m^{2}-5m, which is also incorrect. However, the correct result is -16m^{4} + 6m^{3} + 18m^{2} - 5m.",

            "text": "### -2,2,3 Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the possible rational zeros using the Rational Root Theorem. ### The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational zero of the polynomial \\(j(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12\\) must be a factor of the constant term (12) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). The factors of 12 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 12\\), and the factors of 1 are \\(\\pm 1\\). Therefore, the possible rational zeros are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4, \\pm 6, \\pm 12\\). ## Step 2: Test the possible rational zeros using synthetic division or direct substitution. ### We test each possible rational zero by substituting it into the polynomial \\(j(x)\\) to see if it results in zero. - For \\(x = 2\\): \\[ j(2) = 2^3 - 3(2^2) - 4(2) + 12 = 8 - 12 - 8 + 12 = 0 \\] Since \\(j(2) = 0\\), \\(x = 2\\) is a zero. - For \\(x = -2\\): \\[ j(-2) = (-2)^3 - 3(-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 12 = -8 - 12 + 8 + 12 = 0 \\] Since \\(j(-2) = 0\\), \\(x = -2\\) is a zero. - For \\(x = 3\\): \\[ j(3) = 3^3 - 3(3^2) - 4(3) + 12 = 27 - 27 - 12 + 12 = 0 \\] Since \\(j(3) = 0\\), \\(x = 3\\) is a zero. ## Step 3: List the rational zeros in numeric order. ### The rational zeros are \\(x = -2, 2, 3\\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Problem ### We are given the area of a rectangle as 4x^{2}+11x+6 and one side (length) as L=2x+1. We need to find the other side (width). ## Step 2: Use the Area Formula ### The area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length \\times Width. Here, we have Area = 4x^{2}+11x+6 and Length = 2x+1. Therefore, we can express the width as Width = \\frac{Area}{Length}. ## Step 3: Perform the Division ### Substitute the given expressions into the formula: Width = \\frac{4x^{2}+11x+6}{2x+1}. Perform polynomial division to find the expression for the width. Let's perform the division: \\[ \\begin{align*} &\\text{Divide } 4x^2 + 11x + 6 \\text{ by } 2x + 1.\\\\ &\\text{First term: } \\frac{4x^2}{2x} = 2x.\\\\ &\\text{Multiply: } 2x(2x + 1) = 4x^2 + 2x.\\\\ &\\text{Subtract: } (4x^2 + 11x + 6) - (4x^2 + 2x) = 9x + 6.\\\\ &\\text{Next term: } \\frac{9x}{2x} = 4.5.\\\\ &\\text{Multiply: } 4.5(2x + 1) = 9x + 4.5.\\\\ &\\text{Subtract: } (9x + 6) - (9x + 4.5) = 1.5.\\\\ &\\text{Remainder: } 1.5. \\end{align*} \\] The quotient is 2x + 4.5 with a remainder of 1.5.

Therefore, the definite integral becomes: \\[ \\int_{0.5}^{2} \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx = \\left[ \\ln|x| \\right]_{0.5}^{2} \\] ## Step 4: Evaluate the Integral ### Substitute the limits into the antiderivative: \\[ \\left[ \\ln|x| \\right]_{0.5}^{2} = \\ln(2) - \\ln(0.5) \\] Using the properties of logarithms, we know that \\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right): \\[ \\ln(2) - \\ln(0.5) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{0.5}\\right) = \\ln(4) \\] ## Step 5: Interpret the Result ### The result \\ln(4) corresponds to one of the options provided in the question. We recognize that \\ln(4) is equivalent to the natural logarithm of 4.",

We need to understand the conditions for an equation to have one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions. ## Step 2: One Solution ### An equation has one solution when the variable terms are not equal on both sides, and the constant terms are different. This means the equation can be solved for a unique value of the variable. ## Step 3: No Solution ### An equation has no solution when the variable terms are equal on both sides, but the constant terms are different. This means the equation simplifies to a false statement, such as \\(0 = 5\\). ## Step 4: Infinitely Many Solutions ### An equation has infinitely many solutions when both the variable terms and the constant terms are equal on both sides. This means the equation simplifies to a true statement, such as \\(0 = 0\\).",

This answer seems reasonable given the logarithmic growth model. Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the number of pet owners in 2010 ### To find the number of pet owners in 2010, we first calculate \\( t \\) for the year 2010. Since \\( t = 0 \\) represents the year 2000, \\( t = 10 \\) for the year 2010. Substitute \\( t = 10 \\) into the model \\( n = 35[\\log(t+2)] \\). Using the Change of Base Formula, we have: \\[ n = 35 \\left[ \\frac{\\log_{10}(12)}{\\log_{10}(e)} \\right] \\] Calculate this expression to find the number of pet owners. ## Step 2: Find the year when there are 80,000 pet owners ### Set \\( n = 80 \\) (since the number is in thousands) and solve for \\( t \\) using the equation \\( 80 = 35[\\log(t+2)] \\). Rearrange to find: \\[ \\log(t+2) = \\frac{80}{35} \\] Convert to base 10 using the Change of Base Formula: \\[ t + 2 = 10^{\\left(\\frac{80}{35}\\right)} \\] Solve for \\( t \\) and determine the corresponding year by adding the result to 2000. ## Step 3: Verify the reasonableness of the answer ### Check if the calculated year for 80,000 pet owners aligns with the expected growth trend from the model. Consider whether the exponential growth rate seems plausible given the initial conditions and the function's behavior.",

To complete the square, we take half of the b coefficient, square it, and add and subtract it within the equation. ### \\( \\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{-8}{2}\\right)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16 \\) So, we have: ### \\( y = x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16 + 13 \\) ## Step 2: Simplify to Vertex Form Now, we can rewrite the first three terms as a perfect square and combine the remaining constants. ### \\( y = (x - 4)^2 - 3 \\) This is the vertex form of the quadratic equation, which is generally represented as \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\). ## Step 3: Identify the Vertex The vertex of a parabola in vertex form \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\) is given by the coordinates (h, k).

Arrange the terms in descending order of power. ## Step 2: Divide the Leading Terms ### Divide the leading term of the dividend, -2c^3, by the leading term of the divisor, c, to get -2c^2. ## Step 3: Multiply and Subtract ### Multiply -2c^2 by (c-10) to get (-2c^3 + 20c^2). Subtract this from the original polynomial to get (-47c^2 + 470c). ## Step 4: Repeat the Process ### Divide the new leading term, -47c^2, by c to get -47c. Multiply -47c by (c-10) to get (-47c^2 + 470c). Subtract this from the current polynomial to get 0. ## Step 5: Check for Remainder ### Since the remainder is 0, the division is exact with no remainder.",

            "text": "### No, 2 wins is not a significantly high number. The gambler's prospects are not favorable. Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the Problem ### The gambler plays roulette 50 times, betting on the number 7 each time. To finish with a profit, at least 2 games must be won. The probability of winning a single game is \\frac{1}{38}. For 50 games, the probability of exactly 2 wins is 0.236, and the probability of 2 or more wins is 0.380. We need to determine if 2 wins is a significantly high number and assess the gambler's prospects. ## Step 2: Calculating the Expected Number of Wins ### The expected number of wins is calculated as 50 \\times \\frac{1}{38} \\approx 1.32. This means that on average, the gambler is expected to win about 1.32 times out of 50 games. ## Step 3: Comparing Expected Wins to Actual Wins ### Since the gambler needs at least 2 wins to finish with a profit and the expected number of wins is approximately 1.32, achieving 2 wins is slightly above the expected value but not significantly high. ## Step 4: Assessing the Gambler's Prospects ### The probability of winning exactly 2 times out of 50 games is 0.236, and the probability of winning 2 or more times is 0.380. These probabilities indicate that while it is possible to win 2 or more times, it is not a highly likely outcome. Therefore, the gambler's prospects are not favorable.",

            "text": "-1 Explanation ## Step 1: Observe the polynomial's behavior The polynomial y = x^5 - 3x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 3 is a quintic function. Quintic functions, having an odd degree, must have at least one real root. We are given that this equation has *only* one real root. ## Step 2: Test integer values We can test small integer values of x to see if any of them are roots. * x=0: y = 3 * x=1: y = 1-3+1+2+3 = 4 * x=2: y = 32 - 48 + 8 + 8 + 3 = 3 * x=3: y = 243 - 243 + 27 + 18 + 3 = 48 Notice that when x=2 and x=0, the function value is 3. Since the function is continuous, it must cross the x-axis at some point if the function values go from positive to negative or vice versa. However, we are told there is only one real root. ## Step 3: Rational Root Theorem The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial must be of the form \\frac{p}{q}, where p is a factor of the constant term (3) and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (1). This means the only possible rational roots are \\pm 1 and \\pm 3. We already tested x=1, so let's test x=-1 and x=3. We already tested x=3. * x=-1: y = -1 - 3 - 1 + 2 + 3 = 0 ## Step 4: Identify the real root Since y=0 when x=-1, x=-1 is the real root. Since we are told there is only one real root, we have found it.",

Here, the constant term is -1, and the leading coefficient is 4. Thus, possible rational roots are \\pm 1, \\pm \\frac{1}{2}, \\pm \\frac{1}{4}. ## Step 2: Use Descartes's Rule of Signs ### Descartes's Rule of Signs helps determine the number of positive and negative real roots. For positive roots, count sign changes in 4x^3 - 12x^2 - 9x - 1: there is 1 change (from 4x^3 to -12x^2), indicating 1 positive root. For negative roots, substitute -x into the polynomial and count sign changes: -4x^3 - 12x^2 + 9x - 1 has 2 changes, indicating 2 or 0 negative roots. ## Step 3: Test Possible Rational Roots ### Substitute each possible rational root from Step 1 into the polynomial to find actual roots. Testing x = 1, x = -1, x = \\frac{1}{2}, etc., will help identify which, if any, are roots. ## Step 4: Factor the Polynomial ### Once a root is found, use polynomial division to factor the cubic polynomial into a product of a linear factor and a quadratic factor. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula if necessary. ## Step 5: Solve for Remaining Roots ### After factoring, solve the quadratic equation to find the remaining roots. This may involve using the quadratic formula: x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.",

            "text": "The image of the point (8,2) after a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation is (2,-8). Explanation ## Step 1 The problem involves finding the image of a point after a rotation. The given point is (8,2) and it is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise. It's important to note that a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation is equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation. ## Step 2 The rules of rotation in the coordinate plane are used to find the image of a point after a rotation. For a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the origin, the coordinates of the new point (x', y') are obtained by swapping the x and y values and changing the sign of the new y-coordinate. ### The standard rotation formulas in coordinate geometry are: ### \\(x' = y\\) ### \\(y' = -x\\) ## Step 3 Applying these formulas to the given point (8,2): 1. Swap x and y to get (2,8). 2. Change the sign of the new y-coordinate to get (2,-8). Therefore, the image of the point (8,2) after a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation (or a 90-degree clockwise rotation) will be (2,-8).",

This identity is derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle. ## Step 2: Derive Related Identities ### From the fundamental identity, we can derive other identities by algebraic manipulation. For example, \\sin^2\\theta = 1 - \\cos^2\\theta and \\cos^2\\theta = 1 - \\sin^2\\theta. ## Step 3: Identify the Tangent and Secant Identity ### Another Pythagorean identity involves the tangent and secant functions: \\tan^2\\theta + 1 = \\sec^2\\theta. This identity is derived from the fundamental identity by dividing both sides by \\cos^2\\theta.",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the type of function ### The given expression \\(20,000 \\cdot (0.95)^t\\) is an exponential decay function. This is because the base of the exponent, 0.95, is less than 1. ## Step 2: Determine the rate of change ### The base of the exponent, 0.95, represents the rate at which the population is changing each year. Since 0.95 is less than 1, it indicates a decrease in population. ## Step 3: Calculate the percentage decrease ### To find the percentage decrease, subtract the base from 1 and multiply by 100: \\((1 - 0.95) \\times 100 = 5\\%\\). This means the population decreases by 5% each year.",

To find its slope, we first convert it to slope-intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\). Solving for \\(y\\), we get \\(y = -\\frac{1}{6}x + 8\\). Therefore, the slope of the given line is \\(-\\frac{1}{6}\\). ## Step 2: Determine the slope of the perpendicular line. ### The slope of a line perpendicular to another is the negative reciprocal of the original slope. Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line is \\(6\\). ## Step 3: Use the point-slope form to find the equation of the perpendicular line. ### The point-slope form is \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\). Substituting the point \\((8, 3)\\) and the slope \\(6\\), we get \\(y - 3 = 6(x - 8)\\). ## Step 4: Simplify the equation to the slope-intercept form. ### Simplifying \\(y - 3 = 6(x - 8)\\), we get \\(y - 3 = 6x - 48\\). Adding 3 to both sides, we obtain \\(y = 6x - 45\\).",

We need to find its derivative with respect to \\( x \\). ## Step 2: Use the chain rule ### To differentiate \\( y \\), we use the chain rule. The chain rule states that if \\( y = f(g(x)) \\), then \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) \\). ## Step 3: Rewrite the function using the natural logarithm ### Rewrite \\( y \\) as \\( y = e^{(-4x^4 + 7x^3) \\ln 9} \\). This allows us to use the chain rule more easily. ## Step 4: Differentiate the exponent ### Differentiate the exponent \\( -4x^4 + 7x^3 \\) with respect to \\( x \\). The derivative is \\( -16x^3 + 21x^2 \\). ## Step 5: Apply the chain rule ### Multiply the derivative of the exponent by \\( \\ln 9 \\) and then by \\( y \\). This gives us \\( y' = y \\cdot (-16x^3 + 21x^2) \\ln 9 \\). ## Step 6: Substitute back the original function ### Substitute \\( y = 9^{-4x^4 + 7x^3} \\) back into the derivative expression. This results in \\( y' = 9^{-4x^4 + 7x^3} \\cdot (-16x^3 + 21x^2) \\ln 9 \\).",

            "text": "### The false statement is: The function \\( g(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x^2 + 1 \\). Explanation ## Step 1: Analyze the given statements ### The problem provides four statements about the function \\( g(x) \\). We need to determine which statement is false. ## Step 2: Evaluate the first statement ### The first statement says that the graph of \\( g(x) \\) has two distinct \\( x \\)-intercepts. This means that the function has two real roots. This statement can be true. ## Step 3: Evaluate the second statement ### The second statement says that the function \\( g(x) \\) has at least two imaginary roots. Imaginary roots come in conjugate pairs, so if there are two imaginary roots, there must be at least two more. This statement can be true. ## Step 4: Evaluate the third statement ### The third statement says that the function \\( g(x) \\) is an odd degree polynomial. An odd degree polynomial can have both real and imaginary roots. This statement can be true. ## Step 5: Evaluate the fourth statement ### The fourth statement says that the function \\( g(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x^2 + 1 \\). The factor \\( x^2 + 1 \\) has roots \\( x = i \\) and \\( x = -i \\), which are imaginary roots. This means that the function \\( g(x) \\) must have at least two imaginary roots. This statement can be true. ## Step 6: Determine the false statement ### The fourth statement implies that the function \\( g(x) \\) has at least two imaginary roots, which contradicts the second statement that says the function has at least two imaginary roots. Therefore, the fourth statement is false.",

The key concepts mentioned in the question include \"WASP,\" \"lebensraum,\" \"anti-Semitism,\" and \"Aryan.\" To analyze the correct answer, it's important to understand the meanings and relevance of these terms in the context of Nazi ideology: 1. \"WASP\" (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) is a term primarily used in the United States to describe a particular socio-ethnic group. It was not a term associated with Hitler's ideology. 2. \"Lebensraum\" (living space) was a central concept in Nazi ideology. It referred to the territorial expansion that Nazis believed was necessary for the survival and growth of the German people. 3. \"Anti-Semitism\" was a core element of Nazi ideology, characterized by a deep-seated hatred towards Jews, leading to discriminatory and genocidal policies. 4. The \"Aryan\" concept in Nazi ideology referred to the supposed master race, which they believed to be superior and predominantly included the Germanic people. Given these definitions, the terms \"Aryan,\" \"lebensraum,\" and \"anti-Semitism\" align with the ideology Hitler promoted. The term \"WASP\" is not relevant in this context.",

This type of charge is typically modeled by a linear function, which is continuous. A continuous function is one where small changes in the input result in small changes in the output, without any abrupt jumps or breaks. Since the charge per therm is constant and there are no discontinuities in the pricing structure, the function is continuous.",

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 3, b = -6, and c = -3. ## Step 2: Use the quadratic formula ### The quadratic formula is r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. Substitute a = 3, b = -6, and c = -3 into the formula. ## Step 3: Calculate the discriminant ### The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(3)(-3) = 36 + 36 = 72. ## Step 4: Substitute the values into the quadratic formula ### Substitute a = 3, b = -6, and the discriminant into the quadratic formula: r = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{72}}{2(3)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{72}}{6}. ## Step 5: Simplify the expression ### Simplify \\sqrt{72} to 6\\sqrt{2}, so the expression becomes r = \\frac{6 \\pm 6\\sqrt{2}}{6} = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}. ## Step 6: Identify the correct answer ### The solutions are r = 1 + \\sqrt{2} and r = 1 - \\sqrt{2}, which correspond to option A.",

            "text": "2m^3n Explanation ## Step 1: Simplify the fraction inside the radical: We have \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{80m^{11}n^7}}{\\sqrt[3]{10m^2n^4}}. Using the quotient property of radicals, this can be rewritten as \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{80m^{11}n^7}{10m^2n^4}}. Simplifying the fraction inside gives us \\sqrt[3]{8m^9n^3}. ## Step 2: Apply the cube root: Now we take the cube root of the simplified expression: \\sqrt[3]{8m^9n^3}. The cube root of 8 is 2, the cube root of m^9 is m^3 (since (m^3)^3 = m^9), and the cube root of n^3 is n. ## Step 3: Combine the simplified terms: Combining the simplified terms from the previous step gives us the final simplified expression.",

            "text": "### C. 4 Explanation ## Step 1: Determine the total capacity of the bus for elementary school students. ### The bus has 24 bench seats, and each bench seat can hold 3 elementary school students. Therefore, the total capacity for elementary school students is: \\[ 24 \\text{ seats} \\times 3 \\text{ students/seat} = 72 \\text{ students} \\] ## Step 2: Determine the total capacity of the bus for high school students. ### Each bench seat can hold 2 high school students. Therefore, the total capacity for high school students is: \\[ 24 \\text{ seats} \\times 2 \\text{ students/seat} = 48 \\text{ students} \\] ## Step 3: Calculate the number of high school students that can be accommodated while ensuring the total number of students is 72. ### To maximize the number of high school students, we need to minimize the number of elementary school students. If we assume all seats are occupied by high school students, the maximum number of high school students is 48. However, since the total number of students is 72, we need to adjust the number of high school students to fit the total. ## Step 4: Calculate the number of high school students that can be accommodated while ensuring the total number of students is 72. ### Let \\( x \\) be the number of high school students. Then the number of elementary school students is \\( 72 - x \\). The number of seats occupied by high school students is \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\), and the number of seats occupied by elementary school students is \\( \\frac{72 - x}{3} \\). The total number of seats is 24, so: \\[ \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{72 - x}{3} = 24 \\] ## Step 5: Solve the equation to find the maximum number of high school students. ### Multiply through by 6 to clear the denominators: \\[ 3x + 2(72 - x) = 144 \\] \\[ 3x + 144 - 2x = 144 \\] \\[ x = 24 \\] However, this calculation is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem with simpler logic. ## Step 6: Re-evaluate the problem with simpler logic. ### If we assume all seats are occupied by high school students, the maximum number of high school students is 48. However, since the total number of students is 72, we need to adjust the number of high school students to fit the total. The maximum number of high school students that can be accommodated while ensuring the total number of students is 72 is 48, but since the total number of students is 72, we need to adjust the number of high school students to fit the total. The maximum number of high school students that can be accommodated is 48, but since the total number of students is 72, we need to adjust the number of high school students to fit the total.

            "text": "### x = 1 Explanation ## Step 1: Set the function equal to the given value ### We start by setting the function h(x) = 2x + 2 equal to 4, as given in the problem. This gives us the equation 2x + 2 = 4. ## Step 2: Solve for x ### To solve for x, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 2 - 2 = 4 - 2. This simplifies to 2x = 2. ## Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of x ### Next, divide both sides by 2 to isolate x: \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{2}{2}. This simplifies to x = 1.",

            "text": "### The area of the given region is approximately 2.135 square units. Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Problem ### We need to find the area under the curve y = \\frac{1 + \\ln(x^3)}{x}, above the x-axis, between x = 1 and x = 2. This involves calculating a definite integral over this interval. ## Step 2: Set Up the Integral ### The area under the curve from x = 1 to x = 2 is given by the definite integral: \\[ A = \\int_{1}^{2} \\frac{1 + \\ln(x^3)}{x} \\, dx \\] ## Step 3: Simplify the Integrand ### Simplify the expression inside the integral: \\[ \\frac{1 + \\ln(x^3)}{x} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{\\ln(x^3)}{x} \\] Using the property of logarithms, \\ln(x^3) = 3\\ln(x), we have: \\[ = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{3\\ln(x)}{x} = \\frac{1}{x} + 3\\frac{\\ln(x)}{x} \\] ## Step 4: Integrate Each Term ### Now integrate each term separately: 1. \\int \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx = \\ln|x| 2. \\int \\frac{3\\ln(x)}{x} \\, dx: Use integration by parts where u = \\ln(x) and dv = \\frac{3}{x} \\, dx. - du = \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx, v = 3\\ln(x) - Integration by parts formula: \\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du - \\int \\frac{3\\ln(x)}{x} \\, dx = 3\\ln(x)\\ln(x) - \\int 3\\ln(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx The second integral simplifies to: \\[ = 3(\\ln(x))^2 - 3\\int \\frac{\\ln(x)}{x} \\, dx \\] This requires another integration by parts or recognizing it as a standard integral. ## Step 5: Evaluate the Definite Integral ### Combine the results: \\[ A = \\left[ \\ln|x| + 3(\\ln(x))^2 \\right]_{1}^{2} \\] Evaluate at the bounds: - At x = 2: \\ln(2) + 3(\\ln(2))^2 - At x = 1: \\ln(1) + 3(\\ln(1))^2 = 0 Thus, \\[ A = \\left( \\ln(2) + 3(\\ln(2))^2 \\right) - 0 \\] ## Step 6: Calculate Numerically ### Compute the numerical value using a calculator: - \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147 - (\\ln(2))^2 \\approx 0.480453 - 3(\\ln(2))^2 \\approx 1.441359 So, \\[ A \\approx 0.693147 + 1.441359 = 2.134506 \\] Round to three decimal places: \\[ A \\approx 2.135 \\]",

If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. ## Step 3: Determine the Mode ### The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. If no value repeats, there is no mode.",

            "text": "### The perimeter of triangle FGH is 42 cm. ### The area of triangle FGH is 84.84 cm². Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Problem ### We are given two similar triangles, CDE and FGH. The side lengths of triangle CDE are all 49 cm, making it an equilateral triangle. The height from vertex C to line DE is 42.44 cm. Triangle FGH has a base GH of 14 cm, and we need to find its perimeter and area. ## Step 2: Use Similarity Ratios ### Since triangles CDE and FGH are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. The base DE of triangle CDE corresponds to the base GH of triangle FGH. Therefore, the ratio of their bases is: \\[ \\frac{DE}{GH} = \\frac{49}{14} = \\frac{7}{2} \\] ## Step 3: Calculate the Height of Triangle FGH ### The heights of similar triangles have the same ratios as their corresponding sides. Thus, the height \\( h \\) of triangle FGH can be calculated using the ratio: \\[ \\frac{h}{42.44} = \\frac{14}{49} \\] Solving for \\( h \\): \\[ h = 42.44 \\times \\frac{14}{49} = 12.12 \\text{ cm} \\] ## Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of Triangle FGH ### Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of any pair of corresponding sides is the same. Therefore, each side of triangle FGH is \\(\\frac{14}{49}\\) times the corresponding side of triangle CDE. Let \\( x \\) be the length of the other sides GF and FH: \\[ x = 49 \\times \\frac{14}{49} = 14 \\text{ cm} \\] Thus, the perimeter of triangle FGH is: \\[ GH + GF + FH = 14 + 14 + 14 = 42 \\text{ cm} \\] ## Step 5: Calculate the Area of Triangle FGH ### The area \\( A \\) of a triangle is given by: \\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\] For triangle FGH: \\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 14 \\times 12.12 = 84.84 \\text{ cm}^2 \\]",

(B) all adult residents of the U.S. ### 4. (C) confounding ### 5. (C) How long do students typically wait in line when getting lunch from the cafeteria? Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the purpose of random assignment ### Random assignment in experiments is used to create groups that are roughly equivalent before treatments are administered, ensuring that any differences observed are due to the treatment itself. ## Step 2: Identifying a simple random sample ### A simple random sample ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Using a random number generator to select students from a class fits this definition. ## Step 3: Generalizing survey results ### The largest population to which survey results can be generalized is all adult residents of the U.S., as the sample was a random selection of U.S. adults. ## Step 4: Recognizing confounding variables ### Confounding occurs when it is difficult to distinguish the effects of different factors on the outcome. In this case, both night lights and genetics could influence myopia, making it hard to determine the true cause. ## Step 5: Valid statistical question ### A valid statistical question involves variability and can be answered by collecting data. \"How long do students typically wait in line when getting lunch from the cafeteria?\" is such a question.",

            "text": "### 1. The time required for an object to reach the ground from a height of 100 feet is 2.5 seconds, and from a height of 200 feet is approximately 3.54 seconds. An object that is dropped from twice as high does not take twice as long to reach the ground because the time is proportional to the square root of the height, not directly proportional to the height. 2. The year when approximately 46.16 million trucks were registered is 1992. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the given equation and the height ### The given equation is \\( h = -16t^2 + s \\), where \\( h \\) is the height in feet, \\( t \\) is the time in seconds, and \\( s \\) is the initial height in feet. We need to find the time \\( t \\) when the object reaches the ground, i.e., \\( h = 0 \\). ## Step 2: Set up the equation for \\( s = 100 \\) feet ### Substitute \\( s = 100 \\) into the equation: \\( 0 = -16t^2 + 100 \\). ## Step 3: Solve for \\( t \\) when \\( s = 100 \\) feet ### Rearrange the equation: \\( 16t^2 = 100 \\). Divide both sides by 16: \\( t^2 = \\frac{100}{16} = 6.25 \\). Take the square root of both sides: \\( t = \\sqrt{6.25} = 2.5 \\) seconds. ## Step 4: Set up the equation for \\( s = 200 \\) feet ### Substitute \\( s = 200 \\) into the equation: \\( 0 = -16t^2 + 200 \\). ## Step 5: Solve for \\( t \\) when \\( s = 200 \\) feet ### Rearrange the equation: \\( 16t^2 = 200 \\). Divide both sides by 16: \\( t^2 = \\frac{200}{16} = 12.5 \\). Take the square root of both sides: \\( t = \\sqrt{12.5} \\approx 3.54 \\) seconds. ## Step 6: Compare the times ### The time for \\( s = 200 \\) feet is approximately \\( 3.54 \\) seconds, which is not twice the time for \\( s = 100 \\) feet (which is \\( 2.5 \\) seconds). This is because the time is proportional to the square root of the height, not directly proportional to the height. ## Step 7: Identify the given equation and the number of truck registrations ### The given equation is \\( R = 0.29t^2 + 45 \\), where \\( R \\) is the number of truck registrations in millions, and \\( t \\) is the number of years since 1990. We need to find the year when \\( R = 46.16 \\) million. ## Step 8: Set up the equation for \\( R = 46.16 \\) million ### Substitute \\( R = 46.16 \\) into the equation: \\( 46.16 = 0.29t^2 + 45 \\). ## Step 9: Solve for \\( t \\) ### Rearrange the equation: \\( 0.29t^2 = 46.16 - 45 = 1.16 \\). Divide both sides by 0.29: \\( t^2 = \\frac{1.16}{0.29} = 4 \\). Take the square root of both sides: \\( t = \\sqrt{4} = 2 \\) years. ## Step 10: Determine the year ### Since \\( t = 2 \\) years, and \\( t \\) is the number of years since 1990, the year is \\( 1990 + 2 = 1992 \\).",

            "text": "### B) m\\angle 7=112^{\\circ } Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the Given Information ### We are given that m\\angle 1 = 112^\\circ. We need to find the measures of other angles based on this information and determine which options are correct. ## Step 2: Use Corresponding Angles Postulate ### Since Angle 1 and Angle 5 are corresponding angles, and the lines are parallel, they must be equal. Therefore, m\\angle 5 = m\\angle 1 = 112^\\circ. ## Step 3: Use Supplementary Angles Property ### Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180^\\circ. Thus, m\\angle 2 = 180^\\circ - m\\angle 1 = 180^\\circ - 112^\\circ = 68^\\circ. ## Step 4: Use Vertical Angles Theorem ### Angle 1 and Angle 3 are vertical angles, so they are equal. Therefore, m\\angle 3 = m\\angle 1 = 112^\\circ. ## Step 5: Use Alternate Interior Angles Theorem ### Angle 3 and Angle 7 are corresponding angles (since they are alternate interior angles), so m\\angle 7 = m\\angle 3 = 112^\\circ. ## Step 6: Verify Each Option ### A) m\\angle 6 = 112^\\circ: This is incorrect because Angle 6 is not directly related to Angle 1 by any of the properties used. ### B) m\\angle 7 = 112^\\circ: This is correct as shown in Step 5. ### C) m\\angle 5 = 68^\\circ: This is incorrect because m\\angle 5 = 112^\\circ as shown in Step 2. ### D) m\\angle 2 = 112^\\circ: This is incorrect because m\\angle 2 = 68^\\circ as shown in Step 3.",

            "text": "### B. k\\gt -1.5, C. -1\\lt k\\lt 0 Explanation ## Step 1: Understand the Dilation Concept ### Dilation involves resizing a figure by a scale factor k from a center point C. The coordinates of each point in the original figure are transformed according to the formula: (x', y') = (k(x - x_c) + x_c, k(y - y_c) + y_c), where (x_c, y_c) is the center of dilation. ## Step 2: Identify the Original and Image Points ### The problem provides the image points after dilation: B'(5, 0), C'(5, -5), and B(-3, 0). We need to determine the scale factor k and the center of dilation C. ## Step 3: Calculate the Scale Factor k ### Since B' and B lie on the same horizontal line (y=0), we can use these points to find k. Assume the center of dilation C is at (x_c, y_c). For point B, the transformation gives B'(5, 0) = (k(-3 - x_c) + x_c, 0). Solving for k using the x-coordinate: \\[ 5 = k(-3 - x_c) + x_c \\] Rearranging gives: \\[ 5 = -3k - kx_c + x_c \\] ## Step 4: Consider Possible Centers of Dilation ### Let's test possible centers of dilation given in the options: C(0,0) and C(1,0). ### Case 1: Center C(0,0) Substitute x_c = 0 into the equation: \\[ 5 = -3k \\] Solving for k gives: \\[ k = -\\frac{5}{3} \\] ### Case 2: Center C(1,0) Substitute x_c = 1 into the equation: \\[ 5 = -3k + 1 \\] Rearranging gives: \\[ 4 = -3k \\] Solving for k gives: \\[ k = -\\frac{4}{3} \\] ## Step 5: Verify the Conditions for k ### From the calculations, we have two possible values for k: -\\frac{5}{3} and -\\frac{4}{3}. Both values satisfy k > -1.5 and -1 < k < 0. ## Step 6: Determine the Correct Options ### Based on the calculations, the correct conditions for k are: - k \\gt -1.5 (Option B) - -1 \\lt k \\lt 0 (Option C) ### The possible centers of dilation that match our calculations are: - C(0,0) (Option D) - C(1,0) (Option E)",

Esto significa que si las manecillas son perpendiculares, la hora debe ser 3:00. Si encontramos una hora en la que las manecillas son perpendiculares pero la hora no es 3:00, entonces esa hora será un contraejemplo. ## Paso 2: Analizar las opciones ### Las manecillas de un reloj son perpendiculares en varias horas, no solo a las 3:00. Por ejemplo, a las 9:00, las manecillas también son perpendiculares. Por lo tanto, 9:00 es un contraejemplo de la declaración condicional. # Respuesta: ### 9:00",

            "text": "### The number of each type of product that should be manufactured to maximize profit is 15 units of A and 24 units of B. The maximum profit is 229 thousand dollars. Explanation ## Step 1: Define the Profit Function ### The profit function P(x, y) is defined as the difference between revenue R(x, y) and cost C(x, y). Thus, P(x, y) = R(x, y) - C(x, y). Substitute the given expressions for R(x, y) and C(x, y) to get P(x, y) = (5x + 8y) - (2x^2 - 2xy + y^2 - 7x - 10y + 11). ## Step 2: Simplify the Profit Function ### Simplify the expression for P(x, y): P(x, y) = -2x^2 + 2xy - y^2 + 12x + 18y - 11. ## Step 3: Find Critical Points ### To find critical points, calculate the partial derivatives \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} and \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y}, set them equal to zero, and solve the system of equations. ### \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = -4x + 2y + 12 = 0 and \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 2x - 2y + 18 = 0. ## Step 4: Solve the System of Equations ### Solve the system of linear equations: ### From \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = 0: -4x + 2y + 12 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2y = 4x - 12 \\Rightarrow y = 2x - 6. ### Substitute y = 2x - 6 into \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 0: 2x - 2(2x - 6) + 18 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2x - 4x + 12 + 18 = 0 \\Rightarrow -2x + 30 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 15. ### Substitute x = 15 back into y = 2x - 6: y = 2(15) - 6 = 24. ## Step 5: Verify Maximum with Second Derivative Test ### Calculate second partial derivatives: \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x^2} = -4, \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial y^2} = -2, and \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 2. ### Compute the determinant of the Hessian matrix: D = (-4)(-2) - (2)^2 = 8 - 4 = 4 > 0. ### Since D > 0 and \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial x^2} < 0, the critical point (15, 24) is a local maximum. ## Step 6: Calculate Maximum Profit ### Substitute x = 15 and y = 24 into the profit function P(x, y): P(15, 24) = -2(15)^2 + 2(15)(24) - (24)^2 + 12(15) + 18(24) - 11. ### Simplify to find the maximum profit.",

            "text": "### The false statement is: The function \\( g(x) \\) is an odd degree polynomial. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the roots of the polynomial function \\( g(x) \\). ### The polynomial function \\( g(x) \\) has real roots at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\), and an imaginary root at \\( x = i \\). Since the coefficients of the polynomial are real, the complex roots must occur in conjugate pairs. Therefore, \\( x = -i \\) is also a root of the polynomial. ## Step 2: Determine the factors of the polynomial function \\( g(x) \\). ### The polynomial \\( g(x) \\) can be expressed as the product of its factors corresponding to its roots. Therefore, \\( g(x) \\) has factors \\( (x + 2) \\), \\( (x - 3) \\), \\( (x - i) \\), and \\( (x + i) \\). ## Step 3: Combine the factors to form the polynomial. ### The factors \\( (x - i) \\) and \\( (x + i) \\) can be combined to form \\( x^2 + 1 \\). Therefore, \\( g(x) \\) can be written as \\( g(x) = (x + 2)(x - 3)(x^2 + 1) \\). ## Step 4: Analyze the degree of the polynomial. ### The polynomial \\( g(x) \\) is a product of a linear factor \\( (x + 2) \\), a linear factor \\( (x - 3) \\), and a quadratic factor \\( (x^2 + 1) \\). The degree of \\( g(x) \\) is the sum of the degrees of these factors, which is \\( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \\). Therefore, \\( g(x) \\) is a fourth-degree polynomial. ## Step 5: Evaluate the given statements. ### - **Statement 1**: The graph of \\( g(x) \\) has two distinct x-intercepts. This is true because the real roots at \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 3 \\) correspond to x-intercepts. ### - **Statement 2**: The function \\( g(x) \\) has at least two imaginary roots. This is true because \\( x = i \\) and \\( x = -i \\) are imaginary roots. ### - **Statement 3**: The function \\( g(x) \\) is an odd degree polynomial. This is false because \\( g(x) \\) is a fourth-degree polynomial, which is an even degree. ### - **Statement 4**: The function \\( g(x) \\) has a factor of \\( x^2 + 1 \\). This is true because \\( x^2 + 1 \\) is a factor of \\( g(x) \\).",

            "text": "### The evaluated expression is 1024. Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the base and the exponent ### The given expression is \\(64^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\). The base is 64 and the exponent is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\). ## Step 2: Convert the exponent to a radical form ### The exponent \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) can be expressed as a radical. The denominator of the exponent (3) indicates the root, and the numerator (5) indicates the power. Therefore, \\(64^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\) can be written as \\((\\sqrt[3]{64})^5\\). ## Step 3: Evaluate the cube root of 64 ### The cube root of 64 is 4, because \\(4^3 = 64\\). ## Step 4: Raise the result to the power of 5 ### Now, we need to raise 4 to the power of 5. This is calculated as \\(4^5 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 1024\\).",

The number of red marbles is 20, and the number of green marbles is 70. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(20 + 70 = 90\\). ## Step 3: Calculate the probability. ### The probability of selecting either a red or a green marble is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of marbles: \\(\\frac{90}{100}\\). ## Step 4: Simplify the fraction. ### Simplify \\(\\frac{90}{100}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10: \\(\\frac{90 \\div 10}{100 \\div 10} = \\frac{9}{10}\\).",

            "text": "### The function is increasing on the interval \\( x \\geq 3 \\), the vertex is \\( (3, 0) \\), and the y-intercept is \\( (0, 3) \\). Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the Function ### The function given is \\( f(x) = |x - 3| \\). This is an absolute value function, which means it will always return a non-negative value. The vertex of this function is at \\( x = 3 \\), where the function changes direction from decreasing to increasing. ## Step 2: Analyzing the Function's Behavior ### For \\( x \\geq 3 \\), the function \\( f(x) = x - 3 \\) is increasing because as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) also increases. For \\( x < 3 \\), the function \\( f(x) = -(x - 3) = -x + 3 \\) is decreasing because as \\( x \\) increases, \\( f(x) \\) decreases. ## Step 3: Determining the Vertex ### The vertex of the function \\( f(x) = |x - 3| \\) is at \\( x = 3 \\). Substituting \\( x = 3 \\) into the function, we get \\( f(3) = |3 - 3| = 0 \\). Therefore, the vertex is at \\( (3, 0) \\). ## Step 4: Finding the Y-Intercept ### The y-intercept occurs when \\( x = 0 \\). Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the function, we get \\( f(0) = |0 - 3| = 3 \\). Therefore, the y-intercept is at \\( (0, 3) \\).",

This indicates that it can be solved using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. ## Step 2: Factor the Quadratic Equation ### Notice that the equation can be rewritten as (x-8)^2 = 0 because 64 is a perfect square and -16 is twice the square root of 64. Thus, the equation factors to (x-8)(x-8) = 0. ## Step 3: Solve for x Using the Zero Product Property ### According to the zero product property, if (x-8)(x-8) = 0, then x-8 = 0. Solving this gives x = 8. Since both factors are the same, there is only one unique solution.",

Explanation ## Step1: Identify the Vertex ### The vertex form of a parabola is \\( f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k \\). For the given function \\( f(x) = -x^2 - 3 \\), it can be rewritten as \\( f(x) = -(x-0)^2 - 3 \\). Thus, the vertex is at \\( (h, k) = (0, -3) \\). ## Step2: Determine the Axis of Symmetry ### The axis of symmetry for a parabola in the form \\( f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k \\) is the vertical line \\( x = h \\). Here, \\( h = 0 \\), so the axis of symmetry is \\( x = 0 \\). ## Step3: Establish the Domain ### The domain of any quadratic function is all real numbers, since there are no restrictions on the values that \\( x \\) can take. Therefore, the domain is \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\). ## Step4: Establish the Range ### Since the parabola opens downwards (as indicated by the negative coefficient of \\( x^2 \\)), the range is all values less than or equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex. Thus, the range is \\( (-\\infty, -3] \\). ## Step5: Graph the Parabola ### Plot the vertex at \\( (0, -3) \\) and sketch the parabola opening downwards with the axis of symmetry along \\( x = 0 \\).",

To solve it, we first rewrite it in the standard quadratic form ax^{2} + bx + c = 0. This gives us 3x^{2} + 7x + 5 = 0. ## Step 2: Determine if the quadratic is factorable ### To determine if the quadratic equation is factorable, we need to check if the discriminant (b^{2} - 4ac) is a perfect square. For the equation 3x^{2} + 7x + 5 = 0, the discriminant is 7^{2} - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 49 - 60 = -11. Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation does not have real roots and cannot be factored using standard factoring techniques. ## Step 3: Conclusion ### Since the quadratic equation cannot be factored using standard factoring techniques, the statement is correct.",

A linear function is of the form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) are constants. A nonlinear function does not fit this form. ## Step 2: Analyze option A. ### The equation \\(3y - 4x = 8\\) can be rewritten as \\(y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{8}{3}\\). This is a linear function because it is in the form \\(y = mx + b\\). ## Step 3: Analyze option B. ### The equation \\(y = \\frac{x}{7}\\) is already in the form \\(y = mx + b\\) with \\(m = \\frac{1}{7}\\) and \\(b = 0\\). This is a linear function. ## Step 4: Analyze option C. ### The equation \\(x = 6(2 - y)\\) can be rewritten as \\(x = 12 - 6y\\), which simplifies to \\(y = -\\frac{1}{6}x + 2\\). This is a linear function because it is in the form \\(y = mx + b\\). ## Step 5: Analyze option D. ### The equation \\(y = 3x^2 + 1\\) is a quadratic function because it includes \\(x^2\\). Quadratic functions are nonlinear.",

            "text": "d Explanation The prosperity of the 1920s in the United States, often referred to as the \"Roaring Twenties,\" was characterized by significant economic growth and widespread affluence, impacting various sectors of society. However, not all groups benefited equally from this prosperity. 1. Manufacturers and real estate developers (Option a): These groups generally participated in the prosperity. The 1920s saw a boom in manufacturing due to advancements in production methods, such as the assembly line. Real estate also prospered due to urban expansion and the housing boom. 2. Bankers and construction workers (Option c): Bankers benefited from the booming economy through increased investments and financial transactions. Construction workers were in demand due to the real estate boom and urban development. 3. Stock brokers and automobile workers (Option b): The stock market experienced rapid growth during the 1920s, benefiting stock brokers. The automobile industry was one of the key drivers of economic growth during this period, positively impacting automobile workers. 4. Minorities and railroad workers (Option d): Many minority groups did not experience the prosperity of the 1920s. Racial discrimination and segregation limited their economic opportunities. The railroad industry, on the other hand, faced challenges due to the rise of automobiles and trucks, which reduced demand for rail transport, impacting railroad workers negatively. Therefore, the groups that did not generally participate in the prosperity of the 1920s are minorities and railroad workers.",

The vertex form of a quadratic equation is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex of the parabola. ## Step 3: Complete the square ### To complete the square, we take the coefficient of \\( x \\), which is 6, divide it by 2 to get 3, and then square it to get 9. We add and subtract 9 inside the equation: \\[ y = x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9 + 3 \\] \\[ y = (x + 3)^2 - 6 \\] ## Step 4: Identify the vertex ### The vertex form of the equation is \\( y = (x + 3)^2 - 6 \\). The vertex of the parabola is at \\( (-3, -6) \\). ## Step 5: Determine the range ### Since the coefficient of \\( (x + 3)^2 \\) is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. The minimum value of \\( y \\) is at the vertex, which is \\( y = -6 \\). Therefore, the range of the quadratic equation is \\( y \\geq -6 \\).",

            "text": "The solution to the system of equations is \\((-3, 2, 4)\\). Explanation ## Step 1: Write down the system of equations. We are given the following system of linear equations: \\[ \\begin{cases} 3x + 2y + 4z = 11 \\\\ 2x - y + 3z = 4 \\\\ 5x - 3y + 5z = -1 \\end{cases} \\] ## Step 2: Use the method of elimination to solve the system. ### Eliminate \\(y\\) from the first two equations. Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\(y\\): \\[ \\begin{cases} 3x + 2y + 4z = 11 \\\\ 4x - 2y + 6z = 8 \\end{cases} \\] Add these two equations to eliminate \\(y\\): \\[ (3x + 2y + 4z) + (4x - 2y + 6z) = 11 + 8 \\\\ 7x + 10z = 19 \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)} \\] ### Eliminate \\(y\\) from the second and third equations. Multiply the second equation by 3 and the third equation by 1 to align the coefficients of \\(y\\): \\[ \\begin{cases} 6x - 3y + 9z = 12 \\\\ 5x - 3y + 5z = -1 \\end{cases} \\] Subtract the third equation from the second to eliminate \\(y\\): \\[ (6x - 3y + 9z) - (5x - 3y + 5z) = 12 - (-1) \\\\ x + 4z = 13 \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)} \\] ## Step 3: Solve the resulting system of two equations in two variables. We now have: \\[ \\begin{cases} 7x + 10z = 19 \\\\ x + 4z = 13 \\end{cases} \\] Multiply the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of \\(x\\): \\[ \\begin{cases} 7x + 10z = 19 \\\\ 7x + 28z = 91 \\end{cases} \\] Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \\(x\\): \\[ (7x + 28z) - (7x + 10z) = 91 - 19 \\\\ 18z = 72 \\\\ z = 4 \\] ## Step 4: Substitute \\(z = 4\\) back into one of the equations to find \\(x\\). Using Equation 5: \\[ x + 4(4) = 13 \\\\ x + 16 = 13 \\\\ x = -3 \\] ## Step 5: Substitute \\(x = -3\\) and \\(z = 4\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(y\\). Using the second original equation: \\[ 2(-3) - y + 3(4) = 4 \\\\ -6 - y + 12 = 4 \\\\ 6 - y = 4 \\\\ -y = -2 \\\\ y = 2 \\]",

This involves combining like terms. ### **Like terms** are terms that have the same variables and powers. The coefficients do not need to match. ## Step 2: The second task is to simplify the product of the binomials \\((5x-2)(x+3)\\). This involves using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method. ### **FOIL** stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. It is a method for multiplying two binomials. ## Step 3: The third task is to write the equation of a polynomial given its roots. The roots are the values of \\(x\\) that make the polynomial equal to zero. If the roots are 3 and -5, the polynomial can be written as \\(f(x) = (x-3)(x+5)\\). ## Step 4: The fourth task is to write the equation of a polynomial given its roots. If the roots are -2 and 3, the polynomial can be written as \\(f(x) = (x+2)(x-3)\\). ## Step 5: The fifth task is to write the equation of a polynomial given its roots. If the roots are 1, 3, and 5, the polynomial can be written as \\(f(x) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-5)\\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Understanding the Probability ### The probability of getting three heads when flipping three coins is \\frac{1}{8}. This means that in a single trial of flipping three coins, there is a \\frac{1}{8} chance of getting three heads. ## Step 2: Multiple Trials ### When you flip three coins eight times, each flip is an independent event. The probability of getting three heads in any single flip remains \\frac{1}{8}. ## Step 3: Not Guaranteed ### Even though you perform the experiment eight times, it does not guarantee that you will get three heads at least once. Each flip is independent, and the probability of not getting three heads in a single flip is \\frac{7}{8}. Therefore, it is possible, though unlikely, that you could flip the coins eight times and never get three heads.",

However, the provided options and text are somewhat unclear. Assuming that the correct interpretation is to find the necessary score for Peter to achieve a final average of 5, we need to consider the context of previous scores and the weight of the final exam. Since the exact details of previous scores and weights are not provided, we will assume a simple scenario where the final exam is the only remaining score needed to determine the average.",

The domain is determined by the intersection of the domains of f(x) and g(x). For f(x)=\\sqrt{2x-4}, 2x-4 \\geq 0, so x \\geq 2. For g(x)=x^2-9x, the domain is all real numbers.

Explanation ## Step 1: Factor the equation ### The given equation is \\(a^{3} - 5a^{2} - 14a = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(a\\) from each term in the equation. ### This gives us \\(a(a^{2} - 5a - 14) = 0\\). ## Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression ### Next, we factor the quadratic expression \\(a^{2} - 5a - 14\\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) and add to \\(-5\\). These numbers are \\(-7\\) and \\(2\\). ### Therefore, the quadratic expression can be factored as \\((a - 7)(a + 2)\\). ## Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero ### Now, we have the equation \\(a(a - 7)(a + 2) = 0\\). Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions \\(a = 0\\), \\(a = 7\\), and \\(a = -2\\). ## Step 4: Verify the solutions ### We can verify these solutions by substituting them back into the original equation. For \\(a = 0\\), \\(a = 7\\), and \\(a = -2\\), the equation holds true. ## Step 5: Graph the equation ### To graph the equation, we plot the function \\(y = a^{3} - 5a^{2} - 14a\\). The x-intercepts of the graph correspond to the solutions of the equation, which are \\(a = 0\\), \\(a = 7\\), and \\(a = -2\\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Identify the relationship between time and speed ### The time it takes to cover a distance is inversely proportional to the speed of the car. This means that if the speed increases, the time decreases, and vice versa. Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as \\( \\text{Time} \\times \\text{Speed} = \\text{Constant} \\). ## Step 2: Calculate the constant using the given values ### Given that the trip takes 2 hours at a speed of 49 mph, we can calculate the constant as follows: \\[ \\text{Constant} = \\text{Time} \\times \\text{Speed} = 2 \\, \\text{hours} \\times 49 \\, \\text{mph} = 98 \\, \\text{hour-mph} \\] ## Step 3: Use the constant to find the speed for a different time ### We need to find the speed of a car that makes the trip in 7 hours.

            "text": "### b) Mean: 6.36, median: 7, mode: 7 Explanation ## Step 1: Calculate the Mean ### The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers in the set and dividing by the total number of elements. The sum of the numbers is 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 13 = 70. There are 11 numbers in the set. Therefore, the mean is \\frac{70}{11} \\approx 6.36. ## Step 2: Determine the Median ### The median is the middle number in a sorted list. Since there are 11 numbers, the median is the 6th number in the ordered list. The 6th number is 7. ## Step 3: Identify the Mode ### The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the set. In this set, the number 7 appears three times, which is more frequent than any other number. Therefore, the mode is 7.",

Explanation ## Step 1: List Possible Rational Zeros ### According to the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational zeros of a polynomial are the factors of the constant term divided by the factors of the leading coefficient. For \\( f(x) = 2x^3 + 6x^2 + 5x + 2 \\), the constant term is 2 and the leading coefficient is 2. The factors of 2 are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2 \\). Therefore, the possible rational zeros are \\( \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\). ## Step 2: Test Possible Zeros Using Synthetic Division ### We use synthetic division to test each possible zero. Testing \\( x = -2 \\) using synthetic division yields a remainder of 0, confirming that \\( x = -2 \\) is a zero of the polynomial. ## Step 3: Find Remaining Zeros Using Quotient ### After dividing \\( f(x) \\) by \\( x + 2 \\), we obtain the quotient \\( 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \\). To find the remaining zeros, solve the quadratic equation \\( 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula: \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] where \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = 1 \\). This gives: \\[ x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2i}{4} = \\frac{-1 \\pm i}{2} \\]",

Here, \\( a = -2 \\), \\( h = -3 \\), and \\( k = 2 \\). The vertex of the parabola is at the point \\( (h, k) \\). ## Step 2: Determine the vertex ### Substituting the values of \\( h \\) and \\( k \\) into the vertex form, we get the vertex at \\( (-3, 2) \\). ## Step 3: Identify the axis of symmetry ### The axis of symmetry of a parabola in vertex form is the vertical line passing through the vertex. The equation of this line is \\( x = h \\). ## Step 4: Write the equation of the axis of symmetry ### Substituting the value of \\( h \\) into the equation, we get \\( x = -3 \\).",

Explanation ## Step 1: Calculate the Distance Between Two Points ### Use the distance formula: d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}. For points (-4,0) and (7,-2), substitute into the formula: d = \\sqrt{(7 - (-4))^2 + (-2 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{11^2 + (-2)^2} = \\sqrt{121 + 4} = \\sqrt{125} = 5\\sqrt{5}. ## Step 2: Find the Midpoint of a Line Segment ### Use the midpoint formula: M = \\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right). For endpoints (5,8) and (-1,-2), substitute into the formula: M = \\left(\\frac{5 + (-1)}{2}, \\frac{8 + (-2)}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{2}, \\frac{6}{2}\\right) = (2, 3). ## Step 3: Write the Standard Form of a Circle's Equation ### The standard form of a circle's equation is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. For center (0,3) and radius 2, substitute into the formula: (x-0)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 2^2, which simplifies to x^2 + (y-3)^2 = 4. ## Step 4: Determine the Center and Radius from a Circle's Equation ### The given equation is (x-3)^2 + (y+8)^2 = 16. Compare with the standard form (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. Here, h=3, k=-8, and r^2=16. Thus, the center is (3, -8) and the radius is \\sqrt{16} = 4.",
